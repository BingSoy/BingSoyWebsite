  <h3 class="ptext text">How do I make videos like you?</h3>

    Will have to expand on this later, preferably in video form. For now, links:

  <!--<h3 class="ptext text">How do I tell if it's really you?</h3>
  <p class="ptext text">
    No. Beware fakes.
    guess people were too beware that even bingsoy called fake, reminds me of saitama
    maybe own fault for not explicitly posting steam profile here?
    maybe people simply don't know how to verify through less obvious method of googling a certain profile and checking a list, and comparing urls
    good or bad idea to publicize steam account more openly for sake of ID verify

  <h3>How do you stay inspired to play TF2? </h3>

  <!--do -> did if quit somehow-->
  <ul>
  <li>Challenging game and players; not easy</li>
  <li>Lots of projectile-based gameplay</li>
  <li>Safer game to self-handicap/play non-optimally</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Can do more crazy things since your game character can respawn <span class="dotline" title="but you won't">forever</span></li>
      <li>Doing stuff that can be aesthetically or technically cool (you will fail a lot)</li>
      <li>Huntsman</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Existence of TF2 community and community servers</li>
  <li>Rotating loadouts and playstyles regularly</li>
  <li>More things to be discovered</li>
  <li>Video creation</li>
  <li>Customizability of game (user interface, sounds, models, config scripting, etc.)</li>
  <li>TF2's built-in demo recording system great for filmmakers</li>
  <li>Playing different games or creating something non-TF2 related, taking breaks</li>
  <li>Gameplay is <span class="dotline" title="hitscan sniper rifle, wrangler damage resistance"><i>mostly</i></span> robust; no pay to win affecting gameplay (perspective of a non-random crit server player)</li>
  </ul>

  <!--tired of this, tired of looking at this, should they be ignored? what a bother it is to constantly have the need to justify your own existence as real, like grovelling. theres enough trouble already trying to find a place you belong in the world, trying to live meaningfully in whatever age this is. negativity bias is a thing i guess. oh well.
<h3 class="ptext text">Is Bing Soy an ARG/scripted shenanigans?</h3>
  <p class="ptext text">
    No. Bing Soy realizes his video production speed isn't helping some of these claims since his videos are a main source of sharing who and what he is. In time, they will learn.
    <br />
    Yes, increased attention increases chance of speculation. Certain amount must be tolerated as it will always present for better or worse.
    <br />
    Value words and treat them as if they matter. Don't let your past ruin another's future.
