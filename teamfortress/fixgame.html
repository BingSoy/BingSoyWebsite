    <h2>Fix Team Fortress 2</h2></a>
<p class="text">
  Below are ideas &amp; suggestions of varying priority regarding TF2 game balance with an emphasis on Valve's casual servers. Bing Soy may not necessarily represent the whole TF2 community's will, ideas here are an amalgamation of years of personal TF2 gaming experience and the watching of some TF2 creators to gain more perspective.<br />
  This page changes.<!--Will this page reflect wisdom gained over the years? Will it represent a bitter and selfish player? Will it represent something more reasonable? Let's see.-->

Don't know of any other anti-cheats. Could be useful to supplement modding especially if server has enough popularity that someone feels compelled to take time out of their day to cheat in a videogame, ruining others' gaming experience (and especially since VAC keeps getting bypassed again and again).</li>

    With continued dialogue and community solidarity, Uncletopia can grow and serve as the go to place to heal from Valve casual.<br />    
    Uncletopia could end up hosting a sizable chunk of the TF2 playerbase eventually, if Valve continues to neglect TF2.<br />
    This is the power of one person and his friends.<br />
    Bing Soy is very grateful for the opportunity to play vanilla casual TF2 instead of no-crit deathmatch Hightower servers years on end, after he quit casual.

<h3 class="text">Suggestions</h3>
<p class="subtitle">Take everything you see with a grain of salt. Bing Soy is one person after all.</p>
<h3 class="text">Gameplay related:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove intelligence cap crits.</li>
    <li>Force-a-nature animation/conserve ammo, <s>varying reload speed</s>, alt fire to toggle reload modes when needing to save ammo?</li>
    <li>Short circuit: no metal from cart while active. (like beggars no ammo from dispenser while active, prevent mindless spam; forces you to have downtime encouraging you to plan your shots more)</li>
    <li>Phlogistinator nerf probably?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>no overheal like razorback?</li>
      <li>Is phlog a balanced weapon? does it need nerf? more research needed. but to research this is to not only read but to firsthandedly<!--aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa--></li>
      <li>Too powerful when constantly pocketed?</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Rescue ranger self blast jump resistance.</li>
    <li>Sniper rifles overhaul/refresh</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Seems unlikely they will change much (harder thing to change esp. how long its been same)</li>
      <li>Give the sniper rifles CS:GO AWP movement-based inaccuracy or shot</li>
      <li>Class limits have a big role in team composition balance. Uncletopia is a great example: 3 max snipers can terrorize the battlefield (even if they are very skilled snipers, there are still only 3)</li>
      <li>High speed projectile like Fortnite? (Hitscan remained for every other weapon due to not being long range hitscan).</li>
      <li>Charge Rifle from Apex Legends? Visible laser that deals minor damage, witTh a more damaging blow for the last tick.</li>
      <li>Projectile rules like Rust? Hitscan close range, projectile long range?</li>
      <li>Different sniper projectile rules/speeds/arcs/etc for each sniper rifle?</li>
      <li>Reduced damage on bodyshots; CS:GO-like rules, legs low dmg, body mid dmg, head high dmg</li>
      <li>Add a new/separate projectile sniper rifle for those yearning for projectile-based gameplay, like how the huntsman is different/more challenging (and objectively worse;)</li>
      <li>Give sniper rifles clip+reserve ammo reload (whole clip like smg or incremental like scattergun). Where's the downtime for this high-dmg long range weapon? Or reduce max ammo.</li>
      <li>Lower minimum headshot dmg to 125? Increase time cost to kill heavier classes.</li>
      <li><a href="https://youtu.be/C7Rm5NhTm-k" target="_blank">More coherent 
        Sniper discussion by FishStickOnAStick</a></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Short circuit main fire hit registration fix (inconsistent)</li>
    <li>Bring back the Sandman-Flying Guillotine combo: Balance instead of remove. When equipping this combo, give primary an 100% deploy and 50% holster penalty or some other more thought out balance. Make sandman's slow more reliable?</li>
    <li>Increase flying guillotine max flight time (can't go for ultra long shots). Bring back mini-crits for long range hits (at least ~1408 HU like wrap assassin)</li>
    <li>Make active Damage over Time effects from enemy team (bleed, fire) prevent class/loadout changes at spawn? So enemy that is about to die from fire dies before reaching spawn (must touch lockers to get healed).</li>
    
<!--    <li>Reduce max crit damage of sniper rifles from 450 to 360 (huntsman max crit dmg)</li>-->
<!--    <li>New weapon: deto-jumper: no self damage and no damage and no fire damage. Soldier+demo have their non-damaging jump weapons. Same capping rules as RJ and SJ (like can't carry intel).</li>-->
<!--    <li>Reduce stock stickybomb launcher's clip size to 6: Make grenade launcher primary again. 8 is quite literally overkill.</li>-->

  <ul>
    <li>Huntsman+Fortified Compound string fix. The string stretches wrong (less noticable with FC).</li>
    <li>Make Huntsman/Fortified Compound more accurate to world model (tilt 45 deg). Will also take up less space in resting state.</li>
    <li>Wrangler shooting animations for world model.</li>
    <li>Grenade launcher model to fit clipsize of 4 (4 barrel).</li>
    <li>Loch-n-load model to fit clipsize of 3 (3 barrel).</li>
    <li>Missing killfeed icons. Includes Mini sentry, short circuit, telefrag, etc.</li>
    <li>Sniper gloves first person viewmodel doesn't match world model.</li>
    <li>Spy feign: be able to see fake corpses + fake killfeed of the respective teammate you disguised as. (Assuming the game does this already (clientside) + killfeed shows teammate name but not for you (clientside).</li>
  </ul>
  
<h3 class="text">Communication related:</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Add sniper warning voice lines (from MvM) to voice command menu (voice menu 2, position 9?). Used in a similar fashion to how "sentry ahead" or "spy" voice command is used (specific threat).
        <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/5/52/Medic_mvm_sniper01.wav" target="_blank">Example (medic's line)</a>. Could help your teammates think twice before they cross a certain sightline.

      <li>
        You  are already able to disable specific players' voice chat but not text chat without completely disabling chat, meaning you have to deprive yourself of everyone else's messages just to avoid the few players you don't want to see messages from.

  <p class="text subtitle">These are merely <u>suggestions</u> to help spark dialogue as to how the game can be updated to make it more fair &amp; fresh, therefore more fun and rewarding. Many of these suggestions could very well be bad for the game's health, <u>do not blindly think that these are bulletproof ideas.</u><br />
  This list could be neater and more well thought out, but Bing Soy wants it out there.
  </p>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="https://youtu.be/toxY8lHfs30?t=398" target="_blank">Remove wrangler damage resistance:</a></b>
  &nbsp;The manual control is just fine. The damage resistance turns annoying turtling into something stupidly tanky for a simple weapon switch. It counters the counters to sentries (snipers, LnL, Direct Hit).</li>
  <img alt="TF2 Poster" src="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/7/77/Backpack_Wrangler.png" width="64">
  <li>Make sniper rifles "bullets" into projectiles, like a faster huntsman projectile. Currently, all sniper rifles currently work like lasers (hitscan). Make supportive than just broken laser gameplay denier class? Maybe have some status effects according to which bodypart was hit.? Arm = switchspeed penalty, legs = slow, chest = bleed. Nerf sniper damage, why instant headshot laser?</li>
  <li>Introduce a different primary weapon for scout in the same vein as Dragon's Fury (playstyle changing), with some more risk/reward focus. Supportive? A weapon for scouts that want less linear gameplay. It's nice to have choice between how much brain power you want to commit to a game with defferent playstyles while still being effective in some way.</li>
  <li>Sandman ball damage/status effect distance scaling.</li>
  <li><s><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe0P0rnsS1Q" target="_blank">Fix Iron Bomber hitbox (too big):</a></b> When Bing Soy discovered this he used the iron bomber much less because it felt wrong to be rewarded for an oversight of inconsistency.</s></li>
  <li>Diamondback reward crits should be minicrits: A critical hit too high a reward for simply being an adequate spy. Minicrit allows other players to have a small chance to do gameplay instead of a miniscule chance.</li>
  <li>Ambassador critical cooldown higher, when cooldown headshots minicrit.</li>
  <li>Sapper that explodes and does damage (an old TF2 idea)</li>
  <li>Hothand chargable slap combo, charge too long hand = tired and can't attack a while. Big charge does single hit that crit and knocks back enemy. Quick tap does usual double attack.</li>
  <li>Gas passer fluid affect neon annihilator?</li>
  <li>Remove minicrits pyro reflect?</li>
  <li><b>Make demoman's pills able to explode on collision of enemy/building after hitting a surface:</b> Be able to pull of cool brainy plays as seen in meet the demoman. As seen in <a href="https://youtu.be/han3AfjH210?t=30" target="_blank">meet the demoman.</a></li>
  <li>Ullapool Caber kill taunt, buff damage or make it recharge like sniper's razorback shield which blocks backstabs and recharges every 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>Glow effect wallhacks hurts spy - hide their aura or stop making them blink.</li>
  <li>Don't make auto reload, reload at 0 - mind games gameplay.
  <li>Machina into delayed big laser focus weak ramping warning laser, hard coded sensitivity lock.</li>
  <li>Mini sentry spam cooldown or remove health bonus.</li>
  <li>Scorch shot execution taunt for det</li>
  <li>Fix kick bullying: trust system?</li>
  <li>Casual bonus dailys: item drop/xp bonus for playing in random maps to help players learn and play less popular maps?</li>
  <li>Deadringer makes another noise upon feigned death at very close range and make scoreboard display false stats temporarily.</li>
  <li><s><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwz5yJR_aFA" target="_blank">Fix spy disguise bug</a></s></li>
  <li>Make <s>p2w</s> taunts free or fix them to stand out more (example, boxtrot)</li>
  <li>Make <s>p2w</s> taunts free or incur firing penalty since used to peek thirdperson with instant snap back to first person. Make beggars self fire when highfive, conga, etc.</li>
    shadows
    commands to equip certain weapons with binds/easier item menu
    <li>Class round queue</li>
  <li>Localization.</li>
  <li>Sharpened volcano fragment increase afterburn damage and duration for all classes.</li>
  <li>Make sniper ammo into clips like SMG.</li>
</ul>
  
<h3 class="text">Low priority</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Make viewmodel offset a non cheat command.</li>
    <li>Left viewmodel non mirrored, maybe button to switch hands in gameplay dynamically, firing is affected by left right hand state.</li>
    <li>Cosmetics fit game style.</li>
    <li>dislues as buidings</li>
    <li>TFC birthday month, port popular TFC maps in their goldsrc glory for casual pool.</li>
    <li>VIP civilian mode. Mix gameplay up new/old gamemode. And 10th class will finally be there.</li>
  <li>Viewmodels in general start looking scuffed on higher viewmodel fov. Cut off arms, phantom limbs, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text">Spicy</h3>
<h4 class="text subtitle">Highly experimental ideas probably too "out there"</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="https://youtu.be/kHKJ9Mf8UxU" target="_blank">Leaked content:</a></b>&nbsp;Alternate buildings, weapons, subclass potential.
        <ul><li><b><a href="https://youtu.be/kHKJ9Mf8UxU?t=431" target="_blank">
            DNA gun:</a></b>
            &nbsp;As a shapeshifter/ability steal enjoyer, Bing Soy likes this concept. Has to have a unique particle effect to warn players of a DNA spy. Keep knife for all classes. Add 20% damage vulnerability attribute for as long as not true spy. Remove switch speed penalty - hunter and hunted minigame.</li>
        <ol>

            <li><b>Medic:</b> Gain secondary. Capped at 25% uber. 1 clip worth of primary.</li>
            <li><b>Sniper:</b> Gain secondary. SMG = clip's worth max ammo. Primary = 2 max shots.</li>
            <li><b>Spy:</b> Revert back to a spy. Gives medium health pack worth of HP that can go into overheal. Or, instead of heal, increase max HP like eyelander (limited) only when you have last killed a spy and only when you are spy. Particle effect indicator removed.</li>
