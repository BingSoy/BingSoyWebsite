<h2 class="text">Fix Team Fortress 2</h2>
<p class="ptext text">
  Below are ideas &amp; suggestions of varying priority regarding TF2 game balance with an emphasis on Valve's casual servers. Bing Soy may not necessarily represent the whole TF2 community's will, ideas here are an amalgamation of years of personal TF2 gaming experience and the watching of some TF2 creators to gain more perspective.
</p>
<h3 class="text">Top priority</h3>
<h4 class="text"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHvwijT2ss8" target="_blank">Remove random crits (from casual)</a></h4>

  <p class="text subtitle"><a href="https://youtu.be/J59GKKIyAcI" target="_blank">Uncletopia is a group of servers maintained by Uncle Dane.<sup><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></sup></a><br />
    With continued dialogue and community solidarity, Uncletopia can grow and serve as the go to place to heal from Valve casual.<br />    
    Uncletopia could end up hosting a sizable chunk of the TF2 playerbase eventually, if Valve continues to neglect TF2.<br />
    This is the power of one person and his friends.<br />
    Bing Soy is very grateful for the opportunity to play vanilla casual TF2 instead of no-crit deathmatch Hightower servers years on end, after he quit casual.
  </p>  
<br />

<h3 class="text">General game balance</h3>
  <p class="text subtitle">These are merely <u>suggestions</u> to help spark dialogue as to how the game can be updated to make it more fair &amp; fresh, therefore more fun and rewarding. Many of these suggestions could very well be bad for the game's health, <u>do not blindly think that these are bulletproof ideas.</u><br />
  This list could be neater and more well thought out, but Bing Soy wants it out there.
  </p>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="https://youtu.be/toxY8lHfs30?t=398" target="_blank">Remove wrangler damage resistance:</a></b>
  &nbsp;The manual control is just fine. The damage resistance turns annoying turtling into something stupidly tanky for a simple weapon switch. It counters the counters to sentries (snipers, LnL, Direct Hit).</li>
  <img alt="TF2 Poster" src="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/7/77/Backpack_Wrangler.png" width="64">
  <li>Make sniper rifles "bullets" into projectiles, like a faster huntsman projectile. Currently, all sniper rifles currently work like lasers (hitscan). Make supportive than just broken laser gameplay denier class? Maybe have some status effects according to which bodypart was hit.? Arm = switchspeed penalty, legs = slow, chest = bleed. Nerf sniper damage, why instant headshot laser?</li>
  <li id="sleepy"><b>Pyro vs sentry counterplay:</b>
    Currently, Pyro has atrocious counterplay to sentries. Buff flaregun damage toward buildings? Have flamethrower flames cause sentry inaccuracy/targeting delay when flames block sentry sightline? (pyro is next to sentry and outpositioned/vulnerable/conspicious when doing this) Honorable mention: Dragon's Fury (should learn and use more to observe effectiveness).
    <br /><i>‚ö†Ô∏èUpdate: Bing Soy realizes that Pyro is likely mechanically designed to be underpowered/inferior against sentries/long range,  it is a class &amp; team-based game after all. Therefore, pyros need to compensate for this shortcoming and use their brain as well and decide where to be - protecting a heavy-medic combo against projectiles/spies or risking your current life to destroy the sentry/engineer within sentry nest (most likely failing but all the soldiers and demomen are dead), but it could mean helping your teammates get the final cap.<br />Perhaps much of the frustration of pyro vs sentry gameplay comes from wrangler resistance (especially paired with mini sentry's fast targeting and spamability) and that 1v1-ing an engineer as pyro <b>seems</b> most futile compared to every other class.
    <br />If you do destroy a sentry as pyro, it's probably more impressive than usual considering the difficulty.<br />There is some built-in "balance", considering that your team may have engineers as well, meaning the same problems you have against sentries are applied to the enemy team.
    <br />Ultimately, working with the team or doing something your class is better at (rather than dying useless deaths over and over without changing how you play) is a better approach fo overcoming the sentry. Or maybe on occassion you want to let loose and do something stupid because it's a videogame and you want to have fun and do something new.<br />
    If there so happens to be a certain technique to help counter sentries as pyro, then let's hear it. Learning is good.
    <br />
    üõëüëÉüåπ
    <br />Regardless of whether or not this technique is used, your message has prompted Bing Soy to consider adding some sentry training while he practices in tr_walkway, especially with a newly found command, "ent_create obj_sentrygun" (the built-in sentry feature in the map is too tedious to set up for regular training). Maybe this can help in those moments where he decides to face the sentry (esp. as pyro).<br />
    Many more things to update on this page, let alone the whole site, especially when time changes things and stances. Maybe later. But when is that?<br />Thanks for being thoughtful. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xckBwPdo1c" target="_blank">üëãüõå‚Äçüí§</a></i>
    <br />
    <br />
    <i>to do: update this "later" to reduce confusion for non-sleepy people who read this, reduce words too verbose for this page make user friendly, also line spacing increase probably</i>
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Revert axtinguisher to at least the  love and war update (front=minicrit, back=crit). Or maybe for a twist, front=crit, back=minicrit.</li>
  <li><b>Bring back the Sandman-Flying Guillotine combo:</b> Balance instead of remove.</li>
  <li>Introduce a different primary weapon for scout in the same vein as Dragon's Fury (playstyle changing), with some more risk/reward focus. Supportive? A weapon for scouts that want less linear gameplay. It's nice to have choice between how much brain power you want to commit to a game with defferent playstyles while still being effective in some way.</li>
  <li>Increase flying guillotine max flight time (can't go for ultra long shots)</li>
  <li>Sandman ball damage/status effect distance scaling.</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe0P0rnsS1Q" target="_blank">Fix Iron Bomber hitbox (too big):</a></b> When Bing Soy discovered this he used the iron bomber much less because it felt wrong to be rewarded for an oversight of inconsistency.</li>
  <li>Diamondback reward crits should be minicrits: A critical hit too high a reward for simply being an adequate spy. Minicrit allows other players to have a small chance to do gameplay instead of a miniscule chance.</li>
  <li>Ambassador critical cooldown higher, when cooldown headshots minicrit.</li>
  <li>Sapper that explodes and does damage (an old TF2 idea)</li>
  <li>Hothand chargable slap combo, charge too long hand = tired and can't attack a while. Big charge does single hit that crit and knocks back enemy. Quick tap does usual double attack.</li>
  <li>Gas passer fluid affect neon annihilator?</li>
  <li>Remove minicrits pyro reflect?</li>
  <li><b>Make demoman's pills able to explode on collision of enemy/building after hitting a surface:</b> Be able to pull of cool brainy plays as seen in meet the demoman. As seen in <a href="https://youtu.be/han3AfjH210?t=30" target="_blank">meet the demoman.</a></li>
  <li>Make phlog more creative.</li>
  <li>Ullapool Caber kill taunt, buff damage or make it recharge like sniper's razorback shield which blocks backstabs and recharges every 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>Spy feign animaitons, more gameplay espionage.</li>
  <li>Glow effect wallhacks hurts spy - hide their aura or stop making them blink.</li>
  <li>Rescue ranger blast jump resistance.</li>
  <li>Mini sentry killfeed icon.</li>
  <li>Don't make auto reload, reload at 0 - mind games gameplay.
  <li>Machina into delayed big laser focus weak ramping warning laser, hard coded sensitivity lock.</li>
  <li>Mini sentry spam cooldown or remove health bonus.</li>
  <li>No metal from cart. At least disable cart metal if short circuit.</li>
  <li>Increase short circuit alt fire to 100 metal.</li>
  <li>Scorch shot execution taunt for det</li>
  <li>New weapon: detonator jumper: no self damage and no damage and no fire damage. Soldier has his superior jump and market garden. Throw dog bone.</li>
  <li>Reduce stickys to 4: Make grenade launcher primary again. 8 is quite literally overkill.</li>
  <li>Diamondback/frontier justice 1 crit drain every 5 seconds.</li>
  <li>Fix kick bullying: trust system?</li>
  <li>Casual bonus dailys: item drop/xp bonus for playing in random maps to help players learn and play less popular maps?</li>
  <li>Deadringer makes another noise upon feigned death at very close range and make scoreboard display false stats temporarily.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwz5yJR_aFA" target="_blank">Fix spy disguise bug</a></li>
  <li>Make p2w taunts free or fix them to stand out more (example, boxtrot)</li>
  <li>Make p2w taunts free or incur firing penalty since used to peek thirdperson with instant snap back to first person. Make beggars self fire when highfive, conga, etc.</li>
    shadows
    commands to equip certain weapons with binds/easier item menu
    <li>Class round queue</li>
  <li>Other bug fixes.</li>
  <li>Localization.</li>
  <li>Sharpened volcano fragment increase afterburn damage and duration for all classes.</li>
  <li>Make sniper ammo into clips like SMG.</li>
  <li>Rev penalty for Heavy? Update heavy overhaul.</li>
  <li>No intel crits. Make intel games have timer. Diminishing time returns for capping?</li>
</ul>
  
<h3 class="text">Low priority</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Force a nature animation/conserve ammo, varying reload speed?</li>
    <li>Make viewmodel offset a non cheat command.</li>
    <li>Grenade launcher model (4 barrel).</li>
    <li>Lochnload model (3 barrel).</li>
    <li>Sniper right hand glove remove viewmodel.</li>
    <li>Left viewmodel non mirrored, maybe button to switch hands in gameplay dynamically, firing is affected by left right hand state.</li>
    <li>Huntsman string fix. The string stretches wrong.</li>
    <li>Huntsman/Fortified Compound more accurate to world model (tilt 45 deg). Take up less space in resting state.</li>
    <li>Cosmetics fit game style.</li>
    <li>dislues as buidings</li>
    <li>TFC birthday month, port popular TFC maps in their goldsrc glory for casual pool.</li>
    <li>VIP civilian mode. Mix gameplay up new/old gamemode. And 10th class will finally be there.</li>
  <li>Sniper gloves first person viewmodel doesn't match world model.</li>
  <li>Viewmodels in general start looking scuffed on higher viewmodel fov. Cut off arms, phantom limbs, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text">Spicy</h3>
<h4 class="text subtitle">Highly experimental.</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b><a href="https://youtu.be/kHKJ9Mf8UxU" target="_blank">Leaked content:</a></b>&nbsp;Alternate buildings, weapons, subclass potential.
        <ul><li><b><a href="https://youtu.be/kHKJ9Mf8UxU?t=431" target="_blank">
            DNA gun:</a></b>
            &nbsp;As a shapeshifter/ability steal enjoyer, Bing Soy likes this concept. Has to have a unique particle effect to warn players of a DNA spy. Keep knife for all classes. Add 20% damage vulnerability attribute for as long as not true spy. Remove switch speed penalty - hunter and hunted minigame.</li>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Scout</b>: Gain secondary.</li>
            <li><b>Soldier:</b> Gain Primary with 2 max ammo.</li>
            <li><b>Pyro:</b> Gain primary 50 max ammo. Gain secondary with 2 ammo.</li>
            <li><b>Demoman:</b> Gain secondary with 2 max ammo.</li>
            <li><b>Heavy:</b> Gain secondary. Gain melee.</li>
            <li><b>Engineer:</b> Gain melee. Capped at 50 max metal. Primary = half max clip.</li>
            <li><b>Medic:</b> Gain secondary. Capped at 25% uber. 1 clip worth of primary.</li>
            <li><b>Sniper:</b> Gain secondary. SMG = clip's worth max ammo. Primary = 2 max shots.</li>
            <li><b>Spy:</b> Revert back to a spy. Gives medium health pack worth of HP that can go into overheal. Or, instead of heal, increase max HP like eyelander (limited) only when you have last killed a spy and only when you are spy. Particle effect indicator removed.</li>
