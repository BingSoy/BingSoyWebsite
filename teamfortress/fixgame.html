<h2>Fix Team Fortress 2</h2>
<p class="text">
  Below are ideas &amp; suggestions of varying priority regarding TF2 game balance with an emphasis on Valve's casual servers. Bing Soy may not necessarily represent the whole TF2 community's will, ideas here are an amalgamation of years of personal TF2 gaming experience and the watching of some TF2 creators to gain more perspective.
</p>
<h3 class="text">Top priority</h3>
<h4 class="text"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHvwijT2ss8" target="_blank">Remove random crits (from casual)</a></h4>
<h4 class="text"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHvwijT2ss8&t=1285s" target="_blank">Remove random bullet spread (from casual)</a></h4>
<h4 class="text"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ywM-nePzA" target="_blank">Anti-cheat/bot solutions for all servers</a></h4>
        
<h4 class="text"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0mE34Osrts" target="_blank">Class limits (for casual)</a></h4>
  <br>
  <p class="text subtitle">Want a casual experience that have these simple but effective fixes?<br />
    Consider:
  </p>
  
  <div id="element1"><h1 class="centertxt" id="titlename"><a href="https://uncletopia.com/servers" target="_blank">Uncletopia&nbsp;<sup><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></sup></a></h1>
    <br />
    
    <div><img alt="Uncle Dane" src="https://uncledane.com/dist/thinking_about_feet.bdbcbe04.png" width="150"></div>
  </div>

  <p class="text subtitle"><a href="https://youtu.be/J59GKKIyAcI" target="_blank">Uncletopia is a group of servers maintained by Uncle Dane.<sup><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></sup></a><br />
    With continued dialogue and community solidarity, Uncletopia can grow and serve as the go to place to heal from Valve casual.<br />    
    Uncletopia could end up hosting a sizable chunk of the TF2 playerbase eventually, if Valve continues to neglect TF2.<br />
    This is the power of one person and his friends.<br />
    Bing Soy is very grateful for the opportunity to play vanilla casual TF2 instead of no-crit deathmatch Hightower servers years on end, after he quit casual.

      <li>
        You  are already able to disable specific players' voice chat but not text chat without completely disabling chat, meaning you have to deprive yourself of everyone else's messages just to avoid the few players you don't want to see messages from.

<h3 class="text">General game balance</h3>
  <p class="text subtitle">These are merely <u>suggestions</u> to help spark dialogue as to how the game can be updated to make it more fair &amp; fresh, therefore more fun and rewarding. Many of these suggestions could very well be bad for the game's health, <u>do not blindly think that these are bulletproof ideas.</u><br />
  This list could be neater and more well thought out, but Bing Soy wants it out there.
  </p>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="https://youtu.be/toxY8lHfs30?t=398" target="_blank">Remove wrangler damage resistance:</a></b>
  &nbsp;The manual control is just fine. The damage resistance turns annoying turtling into something stupidly tanky for a simple weapon switch. It counters the counters to sentries (snipers, LnL, Direct Hit).</li>
  <img alt="TF2 Poster" src="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/7/77/Backpack_Wrangler.png" width="64">
  <li>Make sniper rifles "bullets" into projectiles, like a faster huntsman projectile. Currently, all sniper rifles currently work like lasers (hitscan). Make supportive than just broken laser gameplay denier class? Maybe have some status effects according to which bodypart was hit.? Arm = switchspeed penalty, legs = slow, chest = bleed. Nerf sniper damage, why instant headshot laser?</li>
  <li><b>Bring back the Sandman-Flying Guillotine combo:</b> Balance instead of remove.</li>
  <li>Introduce a different primary weapon for scout in the same vein as Dragon's Fury (playstyle changing), with some more risk/reward focus. Supportive? A weapon for scouts that want less linear gameplay. It's nice to have choice between how much brain power you want to commit to a game with defferent playstyles while still being effective in some way.</li>
  <li>Increase flying guillotine max flight time (can't go for ultra long shots)</li>
  <li>Sandman ball damage/status effect distance scaling.</li>
  <li><s><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe0P0rnsS1Q" target="_blank">Fix Iron Bomber hitbox (too big):</a></b> When Bing Soy discovered this he used the iron bomber much less because it felt wrong to be rewarded for an oversight of inconsistency.</s></li>
  <li>Diamondback reward crits should be minicrits: A critical hit too high a reward for simply being an adequate spy. Minicrit allows other players to have a small chance to do gameplay instead of a miniscule chance.</li>
  <li>Ambassador critical cooldown higher, when cooldown headshots minicrit.</li>
  <li>Sapper that explodes and does damage (an old TF2 idea)</li>
  <li>Hothand chargable slap combo, charge too long hand = tired and can't attack a while. Big charge does single hit that crit and knocks back enemy. Quick tap does usual double attack.</li>
  <li>Gas passer fluid affect neon annihilator?</li>
  <li>Remove minicrits pyro reflect?</li>
  <li><b>Make demoman's pills able to explode on collision of enemy/building after hitting a surface:</b> Be able to pull of cool brainy plays as seen in meet the demoman. As seen in <a href="https://youtu.be/han3AfjH210?t=30" target="_blank">meet the demoman.</a></li>
  <li>Ullapool Caber kill taunt, buff damage or make it recharge like sniper's razorback shield which blocks backstabs and recharges every 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>Spy feign animaitons, more gameplay espionage.</li>
  <li>Glow effect wallhacks hurts spy - hide their aura or stop making them blink.</li>
  <li>Rescue ranger blast jump resistance.</li>
  <li>Mini sentry killfeed icon.</li>
  <li>Don't make auto reload, reload at 0 - mind games gameplay.
  <li>Machina into delayed big laser focus weak ramping warning laser, hard coded sensitivity lock.</li>
  <li>Mini sentry spam cooldown or remove health bonus.</li>
  <li>No metal from cart. At least disable cart metal if short circuit.</li>
  <li>Increase short circuit alt fire to 100 metal.</li>
  <li>Scorch shot execution taunt for det</li>
  <li>New weapon: detonator jumper: no self damage and no damage and no fire damage. Soldier has his superior jump and market garden. Throw dog bone.</li>
  <li>Reduce stickys to 4: Make grenade launcher primary again. 8 is quite literally overkill.</li>
  <li>Diamondback/frontier justice 1 crit drain every 5 seconds.</li>
  <li>Fix kick bullying: trust system?</li>
  <li>Casual bonus dailys: item drop/xp bonus for playing in random maps to help players learn and play less popular maps?</li>
  <li>Deadringer makes another noise upon feigned death at very close range and make scoreboard display false stats temporarily.</li>
  <li><s><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwz5yJR_aFA" target="_blank">Fix spy disguise bug</a></s></li>
  <li>Make p2w taunts free or fix them to stand out more (example, boxtrot)</li>
  <li>Make p2w taunts free or incur firing penalty since used to peek thirdperson with instant snap back to first person. Make beggars self fire when highfive, conga, etc.</li>
    shadows
    commands to equip certain weapons with binds/easier item menu
    <li>Class round queue</li>
  <li>Localization.</li>
  <li>Sharpened volcano fragment increase afterburn damage and duration for all classes.</li>
  <li>Make sniper ammo into clips like SMG.</li>
  <li>Rev penalty for Heavy? Update heavy overhaul.</li>
  <li>No intel crits. Make intel games have timer. Diminishing time returns for capping?</li>
</ul>
  
<h3 class="text">Low priority</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Force a nature animation/conserve ammo, varying reload speed?</li>
    <li>Make viewmodel offset a non cheat command.</li>
    <li>Grenade launcher model (4 barrel).</li>
    <li>Lochnload model (3 barrel).</li>
    <li>Sniper right hand glove remove viewmodel.</li>
    <li>Left viewmodel non mirrored, maybe button to switch hands in gameplay dynamically, firing is affected by left right hand state.</li>
    <li>Huntsman string fix. The string stretches wrong.</li>
    <li>Huntsman/Fortified Compound more accurate to world model (tilt 45 deg). Take up less space in resting state.</li>
    <li>Cosmetics fit game style.</li>
    <li>dislues as buidings</li>
    <li>TFC birthday month, port popular TFC maps in their goldsrc glory for casual pool.</li>
    <li>VIP civilian mode. Mix gameplay up new/old gamemode. And 10th class will finally be there.</li>
  <li>Sniper gloves first person viewmodel doesn't match world model.</li>
  <li>Viewmodels in general start looking scuffed on higher viewmodel fov. Cut off arms, phantom limbs, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text">Spicy</h3>
<h4 class="text subtitle">Highly experimental.</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b><a href="https://youtu.be/kHKJ9Mf8UxU" target="_blank">Leaked content:</a></b>&nbsp;Alternate buildings, weapons, subclass potential.
        <ul><li><b><a href="https://youtu.be/kHKJ9Mf8UxU?t=431" target="_blank">
            DNA gun:</a></b>
            &nbsp;As a shapeshifter/ability steal enjoyer, Bing Soy likes this concept. Has to have a unique particle effect to warn players of a DNA spy. Keep knife for all classes. Add 20% damage vulnerability attribute for as long as not true spy. Remove switch speed penalty - hunter and hunted minigame.</li>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Scout</b>: Gain secondary.</li>
            <li><b>Soldier:</b> Gain Primary with 2 max ammo.</li>
            <li><b>Pyro:</b> Gain primary 50 max ammo. Gain secondary with 2 ammo.</li>
            <li><b>Demoman:</b> Gain secondary with 2 max ammo.</li>
            <li><b>Heavy:</b> Gain secondary. Gain melee.</li>
            <li><b>Engineer:</b> Gain melee. Capped at 50 max metal. Primary = half max clip.</li>
            <li><b>Medic:</b> Gain secondary. Capped at 25% uber. 1 clip worth of primary.</li>
            <li><b>Sniper:</b> Gain secondary. SMG = clip's worth max ammo. Primary = 2 max shots.</li>
            <li><b>Spy:</b> Revert back to a spy. Gives medium health pack worth of HP that can go into overheal. Or, instead of heal, increase max HP like eyelander (limited) only when you have last killed a spy and only when you are spy. Particle effect indicator removed.</li>
