<h2 class="text">Scoring</h2>
<p class="ptext text">
  Though it may not be explicitly known, Bing Soy has some sort of personal scoring system/standard. Simply doing something that looks good isn't good enough - it has to be more legitimate. Of course, these are personal, not meant to invalidate you. Hard to explain but he tried to list the general gist of it below. Mostly based on what looks good and what should look good for his videos. The videos themselves will explain better. At the moment, the main channel mostly focuses on interesting gameplay frags in a vanilla TF2 setting. May reword this later to be more coherent. The point right now is to show you that Bing Soy cares about what he shows you. It is suggested you play on Uncletopia to have a feel of where Bing Soy plays in.</p>

-score:</p>
<ul>
  <li>-hitscan</li>
  <li>-spy vs an obviously lower skill team</li>
  <li>-server with random crits/bullet spread (includes casual)</li>
  <li>-server with !rtd</li>
  <li>-hitscan sniper</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe0P0rnsS1Q" target="_blank">-iron bomber (wider hitbox)</a></li>
  <li>-wm1/less thought intensive gameplay (pyro, heavy, etc)</li>
  <li>-tryharding too hard (focusing too much on quantity of kills rather than quality)</li>
  <li>-playing too safe</li>
  <li>-harmless prey (such as hoovy)</li>
  <li>-stealth with no flair</li>
  <li>-sticky spam</li>
  <li>-vs dead ringer spy (makes your frags feel incomplete, empty. maybe if it worked more as a feign more than a shield?)</li>
  <li>-dishonorable/malignant exploits that give you unfair advantage</li>
  <li>-beggars taunt bait</li>
  <li>-p2w taunts used to peek and can be cancelled at will (directors vision permissible as it's free via achievement and it effectively trades a stun for vision)</li>
