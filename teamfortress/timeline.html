<p>Documentation. Incomplete, may stay that way.
  <br />⚠️🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧
  <br />need(?) to fix this page+maybe others, stay more objective here, longevity, precision of words reduce misunderstanding, not everyone shares the same brain - nuances lost, balance saying too much, too little<br />
  </p>
<h4>Present</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Personal health, mindfulness, etc. - increases lifespan of both self and channel.</li>
  <li>Direction of channel, planning, ideas.</li>
  <li>Demo management, backlog, folder structure, categories etc. Very tedious.<!--will pay off if make videos, won't pay off if not make videos or if something prevents from making videos from making/uploading videos like internet connection or death---></li>
  <li>Next video. If too big/takes too long maybe make smaller video not just for channel but for self. If that's too much then try upload on other channel.</li>
  <li>Improving Half Life style HUD for video. More HUD elements revealed as to add more info &amp; context to videos.</li>
</ul>
  <h4>Future</h4>
<p>Don't the count chickens before they hatch 🐣</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding more TF2 videos to the channel, preferably worthy of one's time and perhaps have replay value.</li>
  <li>Spread learned knowledge, especially demo managment and recording. Also share experience as a "YouTube creator", especially if somehow keep uploading (even if slow).</li>
  <li>Set up alternate funding method like donation link ((still hard to gage the sustainability presently) YouTube ads don't seem sustainable for this channel so far, probably acts more as a bonus + way to support YouTube itself since they mainly rely on ads to keep their platform running)</li>
  <li>Unforeseen consequences (try to adapt)</li>
</ul>
  
<h4>Past</h4>
<p>
(unfair) Kicks may be omitted from here, though may find another way to reprimand them.<!--harder issue to address-->

<ul class="tltp">
  <!--<li class="tltp2">2022-10-(08-25): Thinking time after deliberate kick attempt at Uncletopia (votekick then immediately disconnect). No matter what happens there are months/years worth of saved demos, whether they will be put to use is what we'll see. More strategy to combat unfair votekicks (especially being tired from many previous successful ones). votekick abuse also a public display of disrespect and negligence of the spirit of the votekick system. Will continue being decent person with intention to play game and have fun. If people don't like that then ok. If you vote kick someone who really isn't ok with it especially after doing nothing wrong then ok. You get reported, you make new account. Vote fails, I don't want your life to revolve around mine, try getting a job and making money, get what you want in life. If vote is real and I don't know what's wrong, maybe I bring it up, discuss (attempt) then be civilised and resolve, or take break think what I done. Somehow feels strange to protest this, maybe because it's happening in a videogame which people may not fully realize the social impacts of, because of the main feature of entertainment distracting them from other things a videogame may provide.

  <!--<li>2022-10-08: Bing Soy makes a concerted attempt to help solve the unfair (targeted) kick problem. (Silence and peaceful (frags excluded) conduct didn't make it go away, happened too often to be considered "fluke".)
  <br />
  Use the kick system to remove people who are ruining/obstructing the server.<br />
  Examples of who to kick: cheaters, people saying vile things to provoke, people AFK for more than 4 or 5 mins when the server is full with people wanting to join, mic spammers whom nobody asked for or the one who initiated the unfair kick in the first place.

  <li class="tltp2">2022-09-26: Vote-kick responsibly. It's not nice to kick people for no valid reason,  but will that stop you? Will being unfaily kicked be enough for you to ease off the kick button or will it make you a more likely to kick someone with less consideration?

  <li class="tltp2">2022-08-15: Bing Soy's name appeared in the server name of HavFun hightower <!--(like some sort of bat signal)-->. It made him feel welcome enough to join once again in spite of past experiences. It's nice to feel welcome somewhere. Thanks braddles.<!--Since quit before can say appreciate whatever time back again there.

<!--  <li>?–2022-04-13: Backlog of thousands of demos (in-game recordings of gameplay) sorted with a basic but gruelling pass. Further refinement needed. Sorting efficiency ramped up from late 2021. With the basic foundation of the sorting workflow, should be easier to sort, especially while in-game as to not drown in demos again.</li>-->
  <li>2022-03-26: Second channel "Bing Soy Team Fortress: Secondary" is created.</li>
  <li>2021-10-15: Bing Soy quits havfun, "rest" (adapting to stimuli &lt;!-- -->)<!--completely because of a (probably) AFK kick (he thought someone tried to kick him for fun) which reminded him of unfair kicks, bans and bullying that occured at Bunny Co. "Not again" was probably the sentiment at that time. He may have quit bunny co because of those things+specific people, quit so long that it died, bit of a blur, update future.--></li>

  <li class="tltp2">2019-02-07: Plan adapted. Not give up.<!--Damage is already done and the best you do is (if truly care about others, especially strangers) to make an actionable good difference in this world of ours and learn from mistakes. If we don't then we'd live in hell (less air-conditioned one). Shoutout to those who've had "one bad day" moments who've sublimated their frustrations into something productive/non-harmful. Hope people can learn from them. Not harmlessness, but peace.--></li>
