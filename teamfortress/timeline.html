  Documentation. Incomplete, may stay that way.</p>
  
<p class="ptext text">Ongoing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improving his Half Life style HUD for video. Gameplay optimized version not priority. More HUD elements revealed as to add more info &amp; context to videos?</li>
  <li>Sorting clips further, refining, quality control.</li>
  <li>Direction of channel.</li>
  <li>More demos to be sorted.</li>
  <li>Next video. Video making at times hot only technical challenge but psychological challenge. "Is this video me?" "Do they know how I feel?" "Will they believe in my sincerity?" Much to prove. And want to prove something, can't expect handout if do nothing. Think at least prove am real undoubtedly.</li>
</ul>
  
<p class="ptext text">Future (be wary - this can be all talk):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding more TF2 videos to the channel, preferably worthy of one's time and perhaps have replay value.</li>
</ul>

Past (ðŸŒŽ = Third party):</p>
<ul>
  <li id="havfunreturn">2022-08-15 ðŸŒŽ: As a some sort of sign of support, Bing Soy's name appeared in the server name of havfun hightower (like some sort of bat signal). It made him feel welcome enough to join once again in spite of past experiences. It's nice to feel welcome somewhere. Thanks braddles. Since quit before can say appreciate whatever time back again there.</li>
  <li>~2022-08-14 ðŸŒŽ: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrQJIIbzoyQ&lc=UgxsZJkO9-_VUZuPstN4AaABAg" target="_blank">Uncle Dane comments on "The Story of TF2's Strangest Player"</a>, words can't currently express (positive thing), your pride is deserved, example of how being change you want to be can chain reaction good, bing soy hope do same</li>
  <li>2022-08-12 ðŸŒŽ: <a href="https://youtu.be/J59GKKIyAcI" target="_blank">elmaxo uploads "The Story of TF2's Strangest Player"</a>, more eyes are  cast upon Bing Soy, especially in the TF2 sphere</li>
  <li>2022-04-13: Backlog of thousands of demos (in-game recordings of gameplay) sorted with a basic but gruelling pass. Further refinement needed. Sorting efficiency ramped up from late 2021. With the basic foundation of the sorting workflow, should be easier to sort, especially while in-game as to not drown in demos again.</li>
  <li>2022-03-26: Second channel "Bing Soy Team Fortress: Secondary" is created.</li>
  <li>2021-10-15: Bing Soy quits havfun completely because of a (probably) AFK kick (he thought someone tried to kick him for fun) which reminded him of unfair kicks, bans and bullying that occured at Bunny Co. "Not again" was probably the sentiment at that time. He may have quit bunny co because of those things+specific people, quit so long that it died, bit of a blur, update future.</li>
  <li>2021-10-08: Bing Soy discovers Uncletopia.</li>
  <li>2021-08-23 ðŸŒŽ: Uncletopia gets 2 new Australian servers.</li>
  <li>2019-03-11: YouTube channel "Bing Soy Gaming" becomes "Bing Soy Team Fortress".</li>
  <li>2019-02-07 ðŸŒŽ: Damage is already done and the best you do is (if truly care about others, especially strangers) to make an actionable good difference in this world of ours and learn from mistakes. If we don't then we'd live in hell (less air-conditioned one). Shoutout to those who've had "one bad day" moments who've sublimated their frustrations into something productive/non-harmful. Hope people can learn from them. Not harmlessness, but peace.</li>
