  <!--<br />need(?) to fix this page+maybe others, stay more objective here, longevity, precision of words reduce misunderstanding, not everyone shares the same brain - nuances lost, balance saying too much, too little--><br />
  </p>
<h4>Present or updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Take care of yourself</li>
  <li>Develop healthier mindset/responses/strategies to the less positive attention (gossipy/cruel/people taking more liberty with your image (for better or worse) since you have become more "public")</li>
  <li>Next video. Intentionally hype avoid (apart from unavoidable next upload "hype", does this worsen with time?) Just video.</li>
  <li>Try and ocassionally work on smaller things (esp. non-TF2), especially if stuck on harder project (good practice, burnout reduction)</li>
  <li>Demo management, backlog, folder structure, categories etc. Very tedious.<!--will pay off if make videos, won't pay off if not make videos or if something prevents from making videos from making/uploading videos like internet connection or death https://youtu.be/yNi1RRhL0s0?t=70---></li>
  <li>Direction of channel, planning, ideas.</li>

</ul>
  <h4>Future or goals</h4>
  <p><i>Don't the count chickens before they hatch üê£</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding more TF2 videos to the channel, preferably worthy of one's time and perhaps have replay value (subjective? If Bing Soy likes video enough to upload and people like, ok).</li>
  <li>Spread learned knowledge, especially demo managment and recording. Also share experience as a "YouTube creator", especially if somehow keep uploading (even if slow).</li>
  <li>Unforeseen consequences (try to adapt) üîÆüîÆ</li>
  <li>Improving Half Life style HUD for video. More HUD elements revealed as to add more info &amp; context to videos. Also improve personal HUD too.</li>
</ul>
  
  <h4>Past or placeholder</h4>
<p>
  it follows
<!--(unfair) Kicks may be omitted from here, though may find another way to reprimand them.harder issue to address
Use the kick system to remove people who are ruining/obstructing the server.<br />
  Examples of who to kick: cheaters, people saying vile things to provoke, people AFK for more than 4 or 5 mins when the server is full with people wanting to join, mic spammers whom nobody asked for or the one who initiated the unfair kick in the first place. 
  </li>not sure been some time, maybe kicks you understand them more once you experience, people not know?-->

<ul class="tltp">
  <!--<li>2022-10-31 -> ???: Even Bing Soy isn't so skilled at this stage with dealing with certain things. Strange challenges of the 21st century along with figuring out how to operate this vessel, mindful of strengths and weaknesses. Is the only valuable and tangable proof the videos? Whose words matter? Is there a self-fulfilling prophecy at play?</li>
  <li>2022-10-30: Maybe is wasn't so bad, but that's easy to say now that things are made certain/more apparent. Did lose sleep, but it's does undo some discomfort by knowing it's not that bad and good faith was at play. Wish not to torment others with personal past, that's cruel, but wanted to object to a theory uncomfortable with. Silence/avoidance didn't feel enough to dispel, willing to step outside comfort zone to address.<br />
  Whatever happens, must be peaceful, and it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj5vCC_PuSuM8TqQKT9jGTQ/community?lc=Ugy8tUqNrmo9K9Pncgt4AaABAg&lb=UgkxDPyUn-zIf6rBVShWMCXqQ5zT2322LD_H" target="_blank">probably helped</a> show someone that I'm worth reasoning with. Would like to tell more that was in play but can't, oversharing, less privacy, too early. Maybe representation would be helpful to some, for now, use empathy.</li>
  <li>2022-10-30: Blog link on website. (the "<span style="font-family: Twemoji Mozilla">‚ÑπÔ∏è</span> MORE INFO:" link most people seem to not know about at the end of every description). More of an obligated move, wanted to contain to people really interested in more video info but now might as well, like hellevator to help contain further crimson spread, maybe clentaminator later.</li>
  <li>2022-10-29: <i>Timeline update featuring <b><a href="https://bingsoy.com/philosophy/" target="_blank">Bing Soy Philosophy</a></b></i>. (non-conventional response to theory)<br>
  <details>
    <summary>sublimationRoutine_count_nth-statusPublic</summary>
    How does one deal with a mistaken identity? Is it a new challenge throw at you by fate, just as you are finally finding comfort in your identity after losing it for so long? Can your idea of being geniune come off as artificial? Does your behavior resemble someone else's? Does what other people think of you matter, and to what extent? Which people should you take seriously? Did the earth spit you out to be stopped by misled people? Is one's life spent proving and improving themselves? Does your life's journey feel undermined? Do you feel insulted being compared to something you have tried to avoid? Are you ready to deal with <a href="https://youtu.be/UPw-3e_pzqU" target="_blank">inevitability</a>? Will you let these small things stop you, or will you keep sailing the rough sea of life to discover your promised land? Does it ultimately affect you in a severe way? Does it feel worse that you want to say something, but can't because you know no one will believe you? But does that matter if you keep trying to empower/bring joy to others, despite falsehoods undermining you intentional or not? Can you find a way to exist in this new environment, without losing your way? Will telling people how you feel ultimately backfire and harm you? What if you're wrong? Have people seen what you're truly capable of? Are people too scared to talk to you? Are you too scared to talk to people? Are you both scared of jeopardizing your relationships that the fear dooms you to never grow close to anyone? Are they scared of me? Is this how life is, to the very end? Are you ready to show your vulnerabilities with others, or even strangers? Will you build solidarity or alienation? Are you not seeing the bigger picture? Are your intentions pure and do your actions reflect them? Will you follow up a mistake with atonement or will you evade responsibility? Are we all in this together? Are you your thoughts or are you your actions? By emotionally hardening yourself against people who don't like you, do you become numb to those who do? Is "love" the answer? Will the next person who deals with this specific issue be contemplative or go berserk, or maybe both? Can the tempest be tamed? Has the fact that you're more open in your art more than words harmed you? Does being "mysterious" necessarily mean you are more manipulative than people who tell you what you want to hear? Can something as simple as "gaming" cascade into other areas of your life, for better or worse? Will you somehow make everything worse by telling the truth? But shouldn't the truth set you free, so we can start building a better place? Will you be a beacon of hope or malice? Are you over-reacting? Should you judge more on action than speculated intention? Are both action and intent equally important? Can one fool themselves? Did you gain any value from reading this or did you waste time better spent on progressing your own life? Who are you to feel a certain way when others go through [X]? Will you become better at dealing with something the more you are exposed to it or will it slowly poison you? Think outside the box. Are you distracting yourself? Are you reading too much into it? Do you acknowledge the strange position of being one more personally affected by something which others don't understand? Are you too aware of how you act and are perceived that it unsettles you? Have I gotten so distrustful, that my faith in others has run out? Am I drawing parallels that aren't there? Am I seeking hope? Is my idea of fun, someone's suffering? Should I continue to say nothing in fear of losing further touch with others? Is it better to buy into making a statement no one will believe or to sublimate past frustrations coming back to haunt you into the action of doing something productive, like making a video that expresses gratitude and emotion? What does blind hatred accomplish? What does co-operation accomplish? We all make mistakes, but do the mistakes make us? Are negative events the only thing that can get you to talk to others? Did someone's life exist with various experiences in the past? Will people finally acknowledge your identity in the distant future when you're dead and will you care by then? If your hand is forced, will it be closed into a fist to fight or open to consider diplomacy?<br />
  I'm not so sure. I do not know. Is this what it is to be human?<br />
  Keep thinking, maybe you'll figure something out ‚Äì and when you're ready, you can spread the wisdom.

For those that are more confused reading this, try seeing the confusion as the start of higher understanding of the mind (+the nuances that follow) and eventually you will perhaps start to understand yourself more <a href="https://youtu.be/xc3VG9JZM6I?t=6" target="_blank">but</a>.

  <li class="tltp2">2022-09-26: Vote-kick responsibly. It's not nice to kick people for no valid reason,  but will that stop you? Will being unfaily kicked be enough for you to ease off the kick button or will it make you a more likely to kick someone with less consideration?

  <li class="tltp2">2022-08-15: Bing Soy's name appeared in the server name of HavFun hightower <!--(like some sort of bat signal)-->. It made him feel welcome enough to join once again in spite of past experiences. It's nice to feel welcome somewhere. Thanks braddles.<!--Since quit before can say appreciate whatever time back again there.

<!--  <li>?‚Äì2022-04-13: Backlog of thousands of demos (in-game recordings of gameplay) sorted with a basic but gruelling pass. Further refinement needed. Sorting efficiency ramped up from late 2021. With the basic foundation of the sorting workflow, should be easier to sort, especially while in-game as to not drown in demos again.</li>-->
  <li>2022-03-26: Second channel "Bing Soy Team Fortress: Secondary" is created.</li>
  <li>2021-10-15: Bing Soy quits havfun, "rest" (adapting to stimuli &lt;!-- -->)<!--completely because of a (probably) AFK kick (he thought someone tried to kick him for fun) which reminded him of unfair kicks, bans and bullying that occured at Bunny Co. "Not again" was probably the sentiment at that time. He may have quit bunny co because of those things+specific people, quit so long that it died, bit of a blur, update future.--></li>

  <li class="tltp2">2019-02-07: Plan adapted. Not give up.<!--Damage is already done and the best you do is (if truly care about others, especially strangers) to make an actionable good difference in this world of ours and learn from mistakes. If we don't then we'd live in hell (less air-conditioned one). Shoutout to those who've had "one bad day" moments who've sublimated their frustrations into something productive/non-harmful.
