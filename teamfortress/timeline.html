<p>Documentation. Incomplete, may stay that way.
  <br />⚠️🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧 need to fix this page+maybe others, stay more objective here, longevity, precision of words reduce misunderstanding, not everyone shares the same brain - nuances lost, balance saying too much, too little
  </p>
<h4>Present:</h4>
<p>(ongoing)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improving Half Life style HUD for video. <s>Gameplay optimized version not priority.</s> More HUD elements revealed as to add more info &amp; context to videos?</li>
  <li>Direction of channel.</li>
  <li>🌊⛰️ Many demos from backlog being actively sorted. Also making category folder structures more efficient. Much better to sort live instead of huge backlog. A more tidy clip collection will help encourage video creation rather than slowing it down. After category sort, probably quality control esp. for more technical gameplay-focused videos.<br/>
  <!--Rough and simplified video making process (probably expand on this somewhere in future may help some TF2 filmmakers bothered enough with demo system):
  <ul>jhlvutndeltecgndjltgjltjgtljgltjgtjgenltjngtejgnetjgntlgjentlejgndvtlgjednvhltjgendvhtdnhvtdnlhvtdlnhvjgdnhvgjnhvgjdnhvgjnhvgjdnhvjgdnhvjgdnhgvjdghnvjedhgjnvedglsjgsjdjsdjdchegjsdjgdcxehsjgednchgjdech
    <li>1. (Soul rending step) sorting a huge backlog demos into categorical folders (must eliminate this step by live sorting, further developing categories so everything has a place to go, getting familiar with folder structure and not letting unsorted demo folder exceed a certain number)</li>
    <li>2. (More bearable step) refinement of categorized demos, preparation for video, comparatively easier since you don't need to change gears too much for a certain category (like hunstman kills or market gardens)</li>
    <li>3. (Music choice and editing less straightforward)</li>
  </ul>-->
  </li>
  <li>Next video. If too big/take too long maybe make smaller video not just for channel but for self.<!--Video making at times hot only technical challenge but psychological challenge. "Is this video me?" "Do they know how I feel?" "Will they believe in my sincerity?" Much to prove. And want to prove something, can't expect handout if do nothing. Think at least prove am real undoubtedly.<!--What matters more is expressing self rather than grovel and justify own existence.--></li>
</ul>
  <h4>Future</h4>
<p> (be wary - this can be all talk/proof is in the pudding 🍮/don't count chickens before they hatch🐣):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding more TF2 videos to the channel, preferably worthy of one's time and perhaps have replay value.</li><!--if i release more videos that's probably a victory, better than dying without making videos especially with productions that come with much commitment and "soul" if thats a thing, remember your time is limited, do not fear the end too much, but use this fact to remind yourself what matters in your life, dying without fulfilling your dreams is sad, strive, might as well give life a meaning or a purpose since we die anyway, pass on good things for descendants, let's see how long humans survive and whether we can stop fighting with each other and increase civi level, maybe make friends with aliens if possible, collab. philosophy page maybe sometime (but when?)-->
</ul>
  
<h4>Past</h4>
<p>
(Dotted red line = Third Party Action):</p>
<ul class="tltp">
<!--  <li>2???-??-??: Bing Soy dies for real and probably left a decent library of assorted videos. What will become of these videos? Did they truly benefit anyone in the end? Time flies. Your time is limited. How will you spend it? https://youtu.be/dO1rMeYnOmM</li>-->
  <li class="tltp2">2022-09-26: Votekick "joke"/"hazing" incident, mood killer. Is it ok to start votekick for invalid reasons especially to someone who doesn't like it? Does votekick system need overhaul or is it a necessary good and evil? Could be consequence of becoming more known, people may find it more ok to do certain things.
  <!--There are things Bing Soy takes seriously. Use of <a href="https://youtu.be/SUtf9Ajlno4" target="_blank" class="hiddenlink">power.</a>-->

  <li class="tltp2">2022-08-15: Bing Soy's name appeared in the server name of HavFun hightower <!--(like some sort of bat signal)-->. It made him feel welcome enough to join once again in spite of past experiences. It's nice to feel welcome somewhere. Thanks braddles.<!--Since quit before can say appreciate whatever time back again there.
  <br />(2022-08-24: What you say matters. Will protect self. Thanks for showing concern.)--></li>

<!--  <li>?–2022-04-13: Backlog of thousands of demos (in-game recordings of gameplay) sorted with a basic but gruelling pass. Further refinement needed. Sorting efficiency ramped up from late 2021. With the basic foundation of the sorting workflow, should be easier to sort, especially while in-game as to not drown in demos again.</li>-->
  <li>2022-03-26: Second channel "Bing Soy Team Fortress: Secondary" is created.</li>
  <li>2021-10-15: Bing Soy quits havfun, "rest" (adapting to stimuli &lt;!-- -->)<!--completely because of a (probably) AFK kick (he thought someone tried to kick him for fun) which reminded him of unfair kicks, bans and bullying that occured at Bunny Co. "Not again" was probably the sentiment at that time. He may have quit bunny co because of those things+specific people, quit so long that it died, bit of a blur, update future.--></li>
  <li>2021-10-08: Bing Soy discovers Uncletopia.</li>
  <li class="tltp2">2021-08-23: Uncletopia gets 2 new Australian servers.</li>
  <li>2019-03-11: YouTube channel "Bing Soy Gaming" becomes "Bing Soy Team Fortress".</li>
  <li class="tltp2">2019-02-07: Plan adapted. Not give up.<!--Damage is already done and the best you do is (if truly care about others, especially strangers) to make an actionable good difference in this world of ours and learn from mistakes. If we don't then we'd live in hell (less air-conditioned one). Shoutout to those who've had "one bad day" moments who've sublimated their frustrations into something productive/non-harmful. Hope people can learn from them. Not harmlessness, but peace.--></li>
