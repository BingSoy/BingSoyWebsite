<p>
  A restructuring is  in order. Maybe steam guide easier to write 🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧</p>

  <h3>Temp support</h3>
  <p class="text subtitle">To be helpful while you do dumb stuff, not really subclass</p>
<ul>
  <li>Switch to engie, upgrade that tele</li>
  <li>Play medic for a life or two</li>
  <li>Switch to power class for a life to help when losing</li>
</ul>
  
  <h3 class="text">Huntsman Sniper</h3>
  <p class="text subtitle">Sniper revolution</p>
<ul>
  <li>Note that huntsman arrows are projectiles. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvOaUF1Sl5c" target="_blank">How the huntsman works. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjDM6-nLxc" target="_blank">More info.</a></li>
  <li>Trades safety of backlines for high risk/reward gameplay at closer quarters. More personal.</li>
  <li>Taking time to learn huntsman made sniper for Bing Soy from a least favorite to a top favorite class. No instant hitscan, less staying at backlines one-sided gameplay. Shot arc, speed, enemy anticipation, flicks, predictive shots, random shots. Balanced interactions with all classes, counterplay.  <!--<s>It is sad when Bing Soy sees people complain huntsman but ignoring the hitscan sniper.</s>--></li>
  <li>Gamble your current life with the stun/kill taunt at opportuned moments.</li>
  <li>Jarate + Bushwacka = Jarwack</li>
  </ul>
<br />
  <h3>Pyroshark</h3>
  <p class="subtitle">Hungry</p>
<ul>
  <li>Neon</li>
  <li>Detonator and thruster usually</li>
  <li>Airblast prey into water</li>
  <li>If willing teammates you can landshark with milk or jars.</li>
</ul>
<br />
  <h3 class="text">Demoknight + hyrbid knight</h3>
  <p class="subtitle">TF2</p>
<ul>
  <li>Axe+splendid screen = potential to quickly kill non-overhealed heavy or overhealed non-heavy class</li>
  <li>Persian Persuader+shield for frequent charging at cost of lowered max ammo, boots where necessary if don't want to hybrid</li>
  <li>Pill jumping, easiest with Iron Bomber. Also overload jumping with Loose Cannon. Can combine with charge.</li>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/NYma6tXnQQs" target="_blank">Trimping</a> (<a href="https://youtu.be/9qZvZPa_nNg" target="_blank">how?</a>)</li>
  <li>Eyelander+shield+boots=become a <span class="dotline" title="maybe not as much as a hitscan sniper">nuisance</span> for enemy team with your speed and extra shield damage, <a href="https://youtu.be/9qZvZPa_nNg" target="_blank">know when to engage</a> and when to <a href="https://youtu.be/fXXIjF5QrW8?t=36" target="_blank">run away</a> to preserve your head(s).</li>
</ul>
  <br />
  <a class="hiddenlink" href="https://youtu.be/ytQ5CYE1VZw" target="_blank"><h3 class="text">Heavy: Steel-Shotgun Heavy</h3></a>
  <p class="text subtitle">Steel Heavy Walk/Mann of Steel/[catchy name]</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Essentially "fat scout" but you keep your fists up most of the time</li>
  <li>Minigun of choice, The Panic Attack, Fists of Steel</li>
  <li>Be meatbag for team with fists of steel, draw fire from enemy snipers - can survive multiple quickscopes or a fully charged non-Machina headshot (450 * 0.6 = 270)</li>
  <li>Flank</li>
  <li>Huo Long at opportuned moments, hide around corners/drop down, hit them with fire+bullets.</li>
  <li>Tomislav for stealth ambush.</li>
  <li>Learn more advanced weapon switching (knowing when to swap, keeping track of enemy clip/which weapon they are holding – bypass holster penalty by swapping to weapon [A] then desired weapon [B] quickly, etc)</li>
  <li>Beware matadoring spies - looking at the spy doesn't stop backstab as your in-game model rotation is kind of delayed. Shoot at them and choose whether to pursue or flee.</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <h3 class="text">A Battle engie "technique": <a href="https://youtu.be/wkB_Bg9eJ6Q" target="_blank">"Market Pardnering"</a></h3>
  <p class="subtitle">タリパンチマン</p>
<ul>
  <li>More recommended as occasional surprise attack, enemy not expect</li>
  <li>Can use any wrench to mix it up, but gunslinger recommend especially for bullet jumpers</li>
  <li>Gunslinger's minisentry easier to setup especially for bullet propulsion, +25 hp can help (125->150hp)</li>
  <li>Bright blue skies in map while on BLU makes it harder to wrangler bullet jump (can't see laser clearly)</li>
  <li>65+65+195=325 damage for 3 consecutive normal punches</li>
  <li>With Lvl 3 sentry, you can sentry rocket jump, maybe bullet jump combine if overheal for big distance, careful fall damage</li>
  <li>Can use non-wrench too</li>
</ul>
  <br />
  <h3 class="text">Zoomer Medic</h3>
  <p class="subtitle">A worse scout that heals you</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overdose + Vaccinator</li>
  <li>Can get a bit overwhelming from switching weapons frequently, deciding when to uber with which resistance, whether you want to uber or run away with the extra speed or uber 1/2 times with some speed left</li>
</ul>
  <br />
  <h3 class="text">How to play around hitscan</h3>
  <p class="subtitle">Mostly hitscan sniper, not really heavy since he's slow and not long-ranged</p>
<ul>
  <li>Respect the damage and play accordingly</li>
  <li>Sightlines are dangerous, be very careful, navigate your way through map going from cover to cover</li>
  <li>Pick a counter like vaccinator medic (to help team) or fists of steel heavy (makes sightlines less dangerous) or spy or whatever stealthy variation of a class. You may not like having to pick a counter for the hitscan sniper, especially if you are attacking (they don't need to walk as far as you to be effective on front lines)</li>
  <li>Harass with long range projectiles, may not be effective but could be enough to distract them so you can get a push going</li>
  <li>Be wary of the snipers and play whatever class you wanted to play but don't force yourself. Games, especially casual ones shouldn't be so stressful that they cause harm to you.</li>
  <li>If one of those people who go crazy with the wacky strategies, consider being shot down instantly for being reckless as part of the cost of succeeding with those "strategies".</li>
  <li>Disconnect and do something else (don't force yourself others will continue the fight): join different server, different game, draw a picture, go to sleep, talk to friend if you can</li>
  <li>Feel accomplished whenever you kill a hitscan class as you have braved the hitscan which takes much resolve.</li>
  <li>Do something productive (that doesn't require too much brainpower) while respawning: lift weights, cardio, drawing, cleaning room, organising PC files, grooming (combing hair, nails), drink water, stretch, sort clips/demos</li>
</ul>
  <br />
  
  <h2 class="text">More meme intensive/Less viable for steady gameplay/Less helpful for  team</h2>
  <p class="text subtitle">Use in moderation</p>
  <h3 class="text">Spoovy</h3>
  <p class="text subtitle"><i>A worse spy with extra steps</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Not recommended for long periods</li>
  <li>Objectively worse spy. No cloak, not spy speed.</li>
  <li>Buffalo steak and festive punch. Punch the back make laugh then finger gun.</li>
  <li>Finger gun where necessary.</li>
  <li>Feel free to attempt backstabbing techniques.</li>
  </ul>
