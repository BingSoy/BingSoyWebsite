     <h3 class="text">Rebuying owned maps for HM3/WoA</h3>
    
    
    <p>It seems that I'm not so alone in this issue:
      <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/10xc43s/purchase_help/" target="_blank">"Purchase help"</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/larten0423/recommended/1659040/" target="_blank">Steam review on disabling of location import</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/10w9mqd/hitman_2_dlc_owners_now_have_to_rebuy_for_world/" target="_blank">"Hitman 2 DLC owners now have to re-buy for World of Assassination"</a></li>
    </ul>
      
    <p>Although it's nice to get back into HITMAN (at around 2023-02, shoutouts on about page), it's not so nice to find out that you have to rebuy something you already own and even worse finding out that I could've avoided this by getting back into HITMAN earlier than the arbitrary date of 2023-01-26.

  <h3 class="text">Reliance on online servers</h3>
  <p>IOI the game unnecessarily reliant on internet connection, effectively cutting out various features and progression for the game for "offline mode"/anti-cheat. All for the reason of "cheaters".
  <br />
  This isn't good for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>People who want to play offline/don't want to waste unnecessary bandwidth (data caps)</li>  
    <li>People with bad/no internet connection</li>
    <li>Long term videogame preservation, especially when game's popularity dies/IOI HITMAN servers die (maybe the peacock project will continue do what IOI can't)</li>
  </ul>
      
      <p>Some things cut from offline mode (some may be missing from list):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Escalations</li>  
        <!--<li>Online user contracts (can't even save for offline play)</li>-->
        <li>Scoring screen</li>
        <li>Campaign mode (HITMAN 3)</li>
        <li>Progression and
          unlocks</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I don't agree with the whole premise/principle of cutting stuff out for the sake of cheated leaderboards/player profiles (if that's truly the reason), especially since leaderboards are disabled anyway in offline mode and despite that, you're not even allowed to see your own score due to being offline in this singleplayer game.<br />
      Servers don't last forever.

    <p>My "solutions":</p>
    <ul>
      <li><s>Play offline mode, install mods to restore as much as the game possble (probably more mod support in HITMAN 3), make your own scoring screen to restore the satisfaction lost from no scoring screen. Also edit the silent assassin UI back in (disabled in offline mode).</s></li>
      <li>Use <a href="https://thepeacockproject.org" target="_blank">Peacock from The Peacock Project</a>, runs a local server on your PC to replace IOI's sometimes unreliable servers (not 100% offline, must initially have internet connection for steam or epicgames to let you run the game, but after that disconnects should be fine).
      <br />
      Looking into this solution, stress testing to see if too good to be true.</li>
      <li>Avoid unnecessary internet reliance on own projects (if applicable), engage in better business practices with good (or at least better) faith for own fan/playerbase &amp; game's long term health (game's aren't just money, also art/culture)</li>
      <li>Growing the HITMAN channel with these things in mind, seeing what happens</li>
      <li>Don't delude self, act now</li>
    </ul>
