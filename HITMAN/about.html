    <p id="banana">HITMAN is a game where you play as HITMAN Agent 47 where you take out high-profile targets (usually bad guys). I upload gameplay on YouTube of this game.<br />

  <h3 class="text">On "always online"</h3>
  <p>Unfortunately, IOI made questionable decisions making the game unnecessarily reliant on internet connection, effectively cutting out various features and progression for the game if you choose to play offline or have bad/no internet connection. Apparently for the purposes of anti-cheat (which failed anyway).<br />I don't agree with the whole premise/principle of that, especially since leaderboards are disabled anyway in offline mode and despite that, you're not allowed to see your own score due to being offline. Also not good for videogame preservation, especially singleplayer game (quality of life). Servers don't last forever. Watch the videos below for better articulated points.</p>
    
    <p>Possible solutions for "always online" in a singleplayer game (HITMAN):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Play offline mode, install mods to restore as much as the game possble (probably more mod support in HITMAN 3), make your own scoring screen to restore the satisfaction lost from no scoring screen. Also edit the silent assassin UI back in (disabled in offline mode).</li>
      <li>Use <a href="https://thepeacockproject.org" target="_blank">Peacock from The Peacock Project</a>, runs a local server on your PC to replace IOI's sometimes unreliable servers (not 100% offline, must initially have internet connection for steam or epicgames to let you run the game, but after that disconnects should be fine).
      <br />
      Looking into this solution.</li>
      <li>Avoid unnecessary internet reliance on own projects (if applicable)</li>
      <li>Just play how you want (you don't have to subject yourself to these things)</li>
    </ul>
