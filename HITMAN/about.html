    <p id="banana">HITMAN is a game where you play as HITMAN Agent 47 where you take out high-profile targets (usually bad guys). I upload gameplay on YouTube of this game.<br />
    </p>
    <p>Featuring (so far):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Runs of specific routes/methods with focus on speed</li>
      </ul>

  <h3 class="text">On "always online"</h3>
  <p>Unfortunately, IOI made questionable decisions making the game unnecessarily reliant on internet connection, effectively cutting out various features and progression for the game for "offline mode".
  <br />
  This isn't good for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>People who want to play offline/don't want to waste unnecessary bandwidth (data caps)</li>  
    <li>People with bad/no internet connection</li>
    <li>Long term videogame preservation, especially when game's popularity dies/IOI HITMAN servers die (maybe the peacock project will continue do what IOI can't)</li>
  </ul>
    <p>
      The limited offline functionality is apparently for the purposes of anti-cheat (which failed anyway, yet limited offline function still remains).</p>
      
      <p>Some things cut from offline mode (some may be missing from list):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Escalations</li>  
        <!--<li>Online user contracts (can't even save for offline play)</li>-->
        <li>Scoring screen</li>
        <li>Campaign mode (HITMAN 3)</li>
        <li>Progression and
          unlocks</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      Personally don't agree with the whole premise/principle of cutting stuff out for the sake of cheated leaderboards/player profiles (if that's truly the reason), especially since leaderboards are disabled anyway in offline mode and despite that, you're not even allowed to see your own score due to being offline in this singleplayer game.<br />
      Servers don't last forever.
    <br />Watch the videos below for better articulated points.</p>
    
    <p>Possible personal (Bing Soy's) solutions for "always online" in a singleplayer game (HITMAN):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Play offline mode, install mods to restore as much as the game possble (probably more mod support in HITMAN 3), make your own scoring screen to restore the satisfaction lost from no scoring screen. Also edit the silent assassin UI back in (disabled in offline mode).</li>
      <li>Use <a href="https://thepeacockproject.org" target="_blank">Peacock from The Peacock Project</a>, runs a local server on your PC to replace IOI's sometimes unreliable servers (not 100% offline, must initially have internet connection for steam or epicgames to let you run the game, but after that disconnects should be fine).
      <br />
      Looking into this solution.</li>
      <li>Avoid unnecessary internet reliance on own projects (if applicable), engage in better business practices with good (or at least better) faith for own fanbase</li>
      <li>Grow the HITMAN channel while avoiding IOI servers, perhaps prevalence could bring about awareness, steer gamedevs away from needlessly limiting their own games</li>
    </ul>
