<p>Frequently Asked Questions, probably.</p>
  <br />
  <h3 class="ptext text">How do I make videos like you?</h3>

    Will have to expand on this later, preferably in video form. For now, links:

  <li>PSA to demo users: since TF2 being updated like never before, even seemingly small things like map changes can affect your demo playback. Make sure to read the changelogs for map changes and keep backups of the affected map and date them to save your the trouble of trying to track down from an archive which may not exist. Go to tf/maps and save [map that's being updated].bsp, maybe don't have to save every single change, but probably good idea.<br />
  Depending on how much was changed with the map will determine how messed up the map will look.<br />
  Will eventually find out for sure if map saving was worth it in future for video-making involving demos (if old map backups will really work, it should but you never know).

  <h3>How do you stay inspired to play TF2?</h3>
  <p class="subtitle"><a class="hiddenlink" href="https://youtu.be/5IsSpAOD6K8" title="same as it ever was" target="_blank">üç≥„Ç∂</a></p>
  <!--do -> did if quit somehow-->
  <ul>
  <li>Challenging game and players; not easy</li>
  <li>Lots of projectile-based gameplay</li>
  <li>Safer game to self-handicap/play non-optimally</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Can do more crazy things since your game character can respawn <span class="dotline" title="but you won't, extra incentive to switch it up every now and again">forever</span></li>
      <li>Doing stuff that can be aesthetically or technically cool (you will fail a lot)</li>
      <li>Huntsman</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Existence of TF2 community and community servers</li>
  <li>Players who act with basic decency in-game at a higher rate (compared to DotA2, DbD. solo player perspective)</li>
  <li>Rotating loadouts and playstyles regularly</li>
  <li>More things to be discovered (map spots, weapon combinations, ways to frag)</li>
  <li>Video creation</li>
  <li>Customizability of game (user interface (HUD), sounds, models, config scripting, etc.)</li>
  <li>TF2's built-in demo recording system great for filmmakers</li>
  <li>Playing different games or creating something non-TF2 related, taking breaks</li>
  <li>Gameplay is <span class="dotline" title="see fixgame page">mostly</span> solid; no pay to win affecting gameplay (perspective of a non-random crit server player)</li>
    <li><a class="hiddenlink" href="https://youtu.be/atxYe-nOa9w" target="_blank">For fun</a></li>
    <li>Exercise for problem solving skills, strategic problem solving.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Have you died/retired/gone?</h3>
  <p class="subtitle"><a class="hiddenlink" href="https://reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/y9w0ap/hivemind_moment/" title="" target="_blank">R1</a></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Not yet.</li>
    <li>Require evidence.</li>
    <li>Don't invest too much in lives of strangers on internet, they are people (not diety); live your own life.
    </li>
<!--    <li>Trust reputable news source that has been in contact with authorities/mortician. Important to know for sure because of previous people who devalued live/death and the mourning  process. Some may never know how wrong it is to do certain things, especially without good reason and more so without regret/atonement.</li>-/->

  <p>No. Easier for me to reply to comments on YouTube than game chat.
  </p>
  <br /><br />
  
  <h3>When did you start playing TF2?</h3>
  <p>Around January 2012 (<a href="https://truesteamachievements.com/a656/ready-for-duty-achievement" target="_blank">based on my earliest achievement</a>).
  </p>
  <br /><br />
  
  <h3>How many hours played do you have in TF2?</h3>
  <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/bingsoy/" target="_blank">Current hours on my steam profile.</a> Load times, watching demos, AFKing included. High hours not necessarily indicator of skill.
  </p>
  <br /><br />
  
  <h3>Random crits?</h3>
  <p>No.
  </p>
  <br /><br />
  
  <h3>You remind me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sketchek" target="_blank"><span class="dotline" title="Inactive TF2 YouTuber">sketchek</span></a>. Is that you?</h3>
