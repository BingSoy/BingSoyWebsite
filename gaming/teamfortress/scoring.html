<h2>Scoring</h2></a>
  <div class="subtitle" id="ShowText"></div>
<p>
  Though it may not be explicitly known, Bing Soy has some sort of personal scoring system/standard. Simply doing something that looks good isn't good enough - it has to be more legitimate. Of course, these are personal, not meant to invalidate you. Hard to explain but he tried to list the general gist of it below. Mostly based on what looks good and what should look good for his videos. The videos themselves will explain better. At the moment, the main channel mostly focuses on interesting gameplay frags in a vanilla TF2 setting. May reword this later to be more coherent. The point right now is to show you that Bing Soy cares about what he shows you. It is suggested you play on Uncletopia to have a feel of where Bing Soy plays in.</p>
  
<p class="ptext text">+score:</p>
<ul>
  <li>+projectiles</li>
  <li>+precise shots</li>
  <li>+taunting before/after kill</li>
  <li>+taunt kill</li>
  <li>+combo kill</li>
  <li>+teamwork kill</li>
  <li>+using sub-optimal weapons for frags</li>
  <li>+picking up and using others' weapons</li>
  <li>+enemy struggling against you - a back and forth - a fight</li>
  <li>++enemy aware of you (not stealth), this makes for a more challenging encounter</li>
  <li>+fancy stealth</li>
  <li>+risky</li>
  <li>+going for stupid/extremely hard shots</li>
  <li>+market garden (non-simple mgs preferred)</li>
  <li>+killing hitscan snipers without sniper rifle</li>
  <li>+trimp</li>
  <li>+uncletopia (no rnd crits, class limits, casual but more playable)</li>
  <li>+benign "exploits", especially impractical/difficult ones really only useful for memeing or funny kills (like , or ), which are balanced in some way, for example:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>a-posing: funny pose, useless combat-wise, meme value</li>
    <li>kamikaze spam: mostly useless, funny kill, mindgame value</li>
    <ul><li>suggestion in case valve tf2 team wants to patch this: nerf this so instead of no damage dealt to self when doing taunt with map touching sweetspot (near head-ish), its sets you 1 max hp until resupply/death so its more balanced because it is a bit BS (even though it is a bad "strategy"). Or it could straight up be patched out (rip)</li></ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
  
<p class="ptext text">
-score:</p>
<ul>
  <li>-hitscan</li>
  <li>-spy vs an obviously lower skill team</li>
  <li>-server with random crits/bullet spread (includes casual)</li>
  <li>-server with !rtd</li>
  <li>-hitscan sniper (long range, high damage hitscan - no bullet drop, no bullet speed - it's a laser)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe0P0rnsS1Q" target="_blank"><s>-iron bomber (wider hitbox)</s></a> [fixed]</li>
  <li>-wm1/less thought intensive gameplay (pyro, heavy, etc)</li>
  <li>-tryharding too hard (focusing too much on quantity of kills rather than quality)</li>
  <li>-playing too safe</li>
  <li>-harmless prey (such as hoovy)</li>
  <li>-stealth with no flair</li>
  <li>-sticky spam, especially with the stock (8 shots)</li>
  <li>-vs dead ringer spy (makes your frags feel incomplete, empty. maybe if it worked more as a feign more than a shield?)</li>
  <li>-dishonorable/malignant exploits that give you unfair advantage, like tele out of bounds to build unkillable/unseeable sentry that kills enemy team, irregular interp</li>
  <li>-beggars taunt bait w/ dance taunt</li>
  <li>-"p2w" taunts used to peek and can be cancelled at will (directors vision less worse since free and non-cancellable but try to avoid.<br />update: phasing directors vision out, most default taunts make noise, more balanced for thirdperson peeking (TP peeking mostly used when there's a hitscan sniper on other team to find a route to gameplay with closer ranged/projectile classes))</li>
  <li>-proximity to spawn</li>
</ul>
