  <p>Random things (philosophy page pilot/αlpha version):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Neutrality</li>
    <li>Is it truly easier to fool people than to convice them that they were fooled?</li>
    <li>If someone's nature of existence is doubted with poor speculation, what will happen? What's the end goal of this?</li>
    <li>Is war inevitable? Massive loss of life for what and for who. What will future wars be justified for?</li>
    <li>Why are you here?</li>
    <li>Do you feel real?</li>
    <li>Do you know the impact of your actions?</li>
    <li>Will you be recognized for your work before or after your death? Does that matter?</li>
    <li>Life is temporary</li>
    <li>Internet</li>
    <li>Schadenfreude</li>
    <li>Beginner's mind</li>
    <li>Co-existence for humans</li>
    <li>Dehumanization</li>
    <li>Mind open but add healthy skepticism (humans can lie/be inaccurate).</li>
    <li>Discipline, logic, emotion, motivation, purpose.</li>
    <li>Regret of actions, regret of not taking action</li>
    <li>Do your actions matter more than what you think/say?</li>
    <li>What do you know?</li>
    <li>Specialization of professions</li>
    <li>Does what you do have meaning? Does that matter?</li>
    <li>Is death scary? Is dying without accomplishing anything scarier? Conversely, is life scary? Will that stop you from living it?</li>
    <li>Most basic biological purpose: survive, reproduce. Other purpose: man-made?</li>
    <li>Is education system failing? Still failing? Impressionable years.</li>
    <li>Do words mean anything?</li>
    <li>Are we too scared to talk to each other?</li>
    <li>How biased are you?</li>
    <li>How do you treat strangers?</li>
    <li>Do two wrongs make a right?</li>
    <li>Does doing something that aggrevates an already toxic environment because it is toxic, justify this act? Example, littering because there is already litter everywhere.</li>
    <li>How would you feel if you were accused of being false for doing nothing more than being yourself? What message does this convey? Can a discussion help settle this?</li>
    <li>How much of a hypocrite are you?</li>
    <li>Are real-life tragedies more entertainment than news?</li>
    <li>Do you care if others care or do you care more about you caring about how much you care for yourself?</li>
    <li>To be vulnerable and able to be hurt or to be invulnerable and feel nothing? Middle ground?</li>
    <li>Question the emperor (you)</li>
    <li>Self-fulfilling prophecy - by treating someone like a demon, will they become one?
    </li>
    <li>Can black and white mix to make gray? Can a 2 appear?</li>
    <li>By relinquishing control, can you gain it? By being obsessed over control, do you lose it?</li>
    <li>Has the value of human life diminished? Life itself?</li>
    <li>Can philosophizing too much get in the way of normal life duties? Good, bad? Can it help? Maybe so.</li>
    <li>Keep thinking.</li>
    <li>When will you or a friend die? Regrets?</li>
    <li>Are you too serious? Too joking? Taken too serious that people are scared of you? Too joking that no-one takes you seriously? Balance?</li>
    <li>Is what you're saying wrong? Wrong to you? Wrong to others? Factually wrong? Morally wrong? Does it matter?</li>
  </ul>
