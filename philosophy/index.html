  <p>Random things (philosophy page pilot/αlpha version):<br />
  protip, think, meditate (you don't have to do that meditation pose, though it may help some), be mindful, dream if you can
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Neutrality</li>
    <li>Is it truly easier to fool people than to convice them that they were fooled?</li>
    <li>If someone's nature of existence is doubted with poor speculation, what will happen? What's the end goal of this?</li>
    <li>Is war inevitable? Massive loss of life for what and for who. What will future wars be justified for?</li>
    <li>Why are you here?</li>
    <li>Do you feel real?</li>
    <li>Do you know the impact of your actions?</li>
    <li>Will you be recognized for your work before or after your death? Does that matter?</li>
    <li>Life is temporary</li>
    <li>Internet</li>
    <li>Schadenfreude</li>
    <li>Beginner's mind</li>
    <li>Co-existence for humans</li>
    <li>Dehumanization</li>
    <li>Mind open but add healthy skepticism (humans can lie/be inaccurate).</li>
    <li>Discipline, logic, emotion, motivation, purpose.</li>
    <li>Regret of actions, regret of not taking action</li>
    <li>Do your actions matter more than what you think/say?</li>
    <li>What do you know?</li>
    <li>Specialization of professions</li>
    <li>Does what you do have meaning? Does that matter?</li>
    <li>Is death scary? Is dying without accomplishing anything scarier? Conversely, is life scary? Will that stop you from living it? (memento mori)</li>
    <li>Most basic biological purpose: survive, reproduce. Other purpose: man-made?</li>
    <li>Is education system failing? Still failing? Impressionable years.</li>
    <li>Do words mean anything?</li>
    <li>Are we too scared to talk to each other?</li>
    <li>How biased are you?</li>
    <li>How do you treat strangers?</li>
    <li>Do two wrongs make a right?</li>
    <li>Does doing something that aggrevates an already toxic environment because it is toxic, justify this act? Example, littering because there is already litter everywhere.</li>
    <li>How would you feel if you were accused of being false for doing nothing more than being yourself? What message does this convey? Can a discussion help settle this?</li>
    <li>How much of a hypocrite are you?</li>
    <li>Are real-life tragedies more entertainment than news?</li>
    <li>Do you care if others care or do you care more about you caring about how much you care for yourself?</li>
    <li>To be vulnerable and able to be hurt or to be invulnerable and feel nothing? Middle ground?</li>
    <li>Question the emperor (you)</li>
    <li>Self-fulfilling prophecy - by treating someone like a demon, will they become one?
    </li>
    <li>Can black and white mix to make gray? Can a 2 appear?</li>
    <li>By relinquishing control, can you gain it? By being obsessed over control, do you lose it?</li>
    <li>Has the value of human life diminished? Life itself?</li>
    <li>Can philosophizing too much get in the way of normal life duties? Good, bad? Can it help? Maybe so.</li>
    <li>Keep thinking.</li>
    <li>When will you or a friend die? Regrets?</li>
    <li>Are you too serious? Too joking? Taken too serious that people are scared of you? Too joking that no-one takes you seriously? Balance?</li>
    <li>Is what you're saying wrong? Wrong to you? Wrong to others? Factually wrong? Morally wrong? Does it matter?</li>
    <li>Is everthing a projection of self, good and bad?</li>
    <li>Is bullying ultimately a projection of insecurity and weakness? Example: people would rather harass a weaker target like a child rather than to utilize this predatory instinct to work with law enforcement to put violent criminals behind bars (sublimation).
    <br />Note than bullying can ultimately result in severe things such as self-harm and harm of others (of varying degrees). Humans don't seem to like being bullied and may do something drastic if unaddressed. Build mental insulation against bad actors via friends, family, mental discipline, physical strength training, relevant authorities if applicable.
    <br />Other possible reasons why people bully: underdeveloped/twisted morality, mental conditions, abusive family/friend group members, peer pressure. Treat people like people? But it's never that simple. Bullying is a much harder issue to attack if you are someone in the middle of it/younger/don't have the tools or knowledge to combat it.</li>
    <li>Can criticism be destructive? Constructive? What is the intent of the critique?</li>
    <li>Should most of your identity's value come from your character and their actions, rather than appearance alone?</li>
    <li>It is said that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but isn't that what we do regardless?</li>
    <li>If someone is known for doing a certain thing, and they don't do the thing, does that mean they are a fake? Example: a sad person somehow finds the strength to turn their life around (but still carries much sadness within them but doesn't want to be overly overtly negative as they want to spread more positivity than negative) - does that mean they were faking being sad for attention and sympathy?</li>
    <li>By treating someone as [X] do they become [X]? (self-fulfilling prophecy)</li>
    <li>Are you getting any value from this? Are you wasting your time?</li>
    <li>Does your inner voice speak in tandem with your physical voice? Are you reading this with your inner voice?</li>
    <li>Do intentions and context matter?</li>
    <li>Have you looked in the mirror? The person that looks back is you. But do you believe that it's you? (your mileage may vary)</li>
    <li>You may seek validation from others, but have you seeked it from yourself?</li>
    <li>Will you be able to break negative loops?</li>
    <li>Pay it forward.</li>
    <li>Shame is often weaponized to reduce groups/individuals. Is this group/individual truly harmful to anyone or are you shaming them to fulfill an untamed, unrealized dark side of you?</li>
    <li>Do you care about this world? Will you leave it a better or worse place for others?</li>
    <li>Are you taking what you have for granted? Things change, lifeforms expire.</li>
    <li>What gives your life meaning/value?</li>
    <li>What are your plans/goals?</li>
    <li>Is unadressed pain/trauma affecting your life? Will you ever know?</li>
    <li>Buyback potential years back on your life by excercising regularly, avoiding unnecessary stress/mental discipline and eating healthier. If you can find a way to keep this up long term - even slightly - that is a win.</li>
    <li>Is there only so much "healing" one can do to remedy their lost potential?</li>
    <li>Does fear become rage?</li>
    <li>Nuance.</li>
    <li>Do humans need to hunt to keep our hunting instinct tame and alive? Hunting in this case can be something like working a job to provide for yourself/family. If you don't hunt, do you become complacent?</li>
    <li>Learning is forever.</li>
    <li>Can humans learn to stop fighting with each other and go colonize space sooner? The clock is ticking (estimated ~5 billion years for sun to possibly expand into Earth <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/" target="_blank">according to NASA</a>).<br />
    Possible unborn future generations would probably appreciate being alive and not dead from wasted time caused by short-sighted wars on ourselves.<br />
    There's no time like the present.<br />
    What you can do to help: be a positive presence on this Earth->Solar System->Galaxy->Supercluster->Universe->??????, humans specialize in professions - <a href="https://youtu.be/KV2ssT8lzj8?t=82" target="_blank">be good at what you do</a>, not everyone can be in a field relevant to space travel/colonization, <a href="https://youtu.be/20LuSlZT4S4" target="_blank">humans help each other</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Is it possible to extract meaning is something meaningless or something that has both meaningfulness and meaninglessness? What does "mean" mean? What does it mean to "mean"?</li>
    <li>Is mercy a weakness or an advanced moral trait or both or neither or a variable mix?</li>
    <li>Can an obsession with morality be immoral, and vice versa?</li>
    <li>Does asking questions make you a fool? Does learning make you a fool?</li>
    <li>Can a meaning of life be to seek it itself?</li>
    <li>Does not requiring a deity/religion to be moral make you any less moral? Can religious and non-religious live in peace?</li>
    <li>Can one gain control but relinquishing it?</li>
    <li>Can one gain free will by acknowledging that there is none? (warning: make up your own mind about free-will, probably scary for some, but nothing is immune to questioning, especially fundamental things that make you human/[species name for other sentient lifeforms that evolve to human-like intelligence])</li>
    <li>Is free-will truly free?</li>
  </ul>
