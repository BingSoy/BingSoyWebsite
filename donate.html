    <p class="ptext text">
        <br />
        Support is appreciated. Please feel no pressure to donate.<br />Bing Soy will always try to find a way to do what he is passionate about no matter what, but money would help secure him financially in the future, as our civilization largely relies on fiat currency as a universal token to trade for most things, such as food, water, shelter and art supplies.

          <li>Time + internet bandwidth.</li>
          <li>Install a trustworthy adblocker if you don't like ads.<br />Ads have become so intrusive that people feel the need use adblockers to viably browse the web. If only there was some sort of web standard for ads where everyone can win.</li>
          <li>YouTube takes â‰ˆ45% cut of ad money made from creators.</li>

    <h4 class="text"><s>Via "Buy me a coffee":</s></h4>
      <ul>
          <li>Money donation.</li>
          <li>$1 minimum. (can't set lower)</li>
          <li>Buy Me a Coffee takes 5% in transaction fees.</li>
          <li>At this moment, Bing Soy recommends donating to people who need the money more.</li>
          <li>Button hidden for now in case people think they are getting a personal thank you or guaranteed videos. Bing Soy gives a global thank you in the form of his videos themselves, and god forbid these videos become forced. Maybe it's better for people to get a better idea of what Bing Soy is before they give him their hard-earned money.</li>
