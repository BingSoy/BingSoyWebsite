  <h2 id="editingsoftware" title="in regard to">Editing software I use</h2>
  <p>Notice: make sure to try free/trial versions of softwares before you buy. Consider alternatives (especially others not listed here), availability of tutorials, watch other people use the software, pricing and other stuff you may need to know. You don't necessarily have to be bound to 1 software as many have their strengths/weaknesses.</p>
  <br />
  
  <h3>HitFilm (Pro) by FXhome</h3>
  <h4 class="subtitle"><a href="https://account.fxhome.com/install" target="_blank">Free version</a> or <a href="https://fxhome.com/pricing" target="_blank">subscription</a> or <a href="https://legacy.fxhome.com/store" target="_blank">12-month-update-locked perpetual license (USD$349)</a></h4>
  <p>
    My main editing software. Has a free version.
    <br /><br />
    If you must buy, get the perpetual license. Note that their "perpetual" licence requires you pay for updates once 12 months have passed from your original purchase. Don't feel inclined to keep paying for updates, it should be a complete software. I use an old version from 2019, though my rate stretch tool is broken (changing clip speed buggy).
    <br />
    Has a free version – <a href="https://youtu.be/ESLNhYNP-8I" target="_blank">but in a 2022 update, it became more restricted</a>.
    <br />
    <br />
    General advice: stick to (actual) perpetual licenses and open source softwares — save money and have no fear about being locked out of own projects.
    <br /><br />
    From what I see, you have access to previous versions only from the time of purchase to time when your paid updates expire (access via account page).
    <br />
    Example: if you bought HitFilm Pro in 2017-02-01 and the last update was on 2017-01-01, you don't have access to previous version's installers from before 2017-01-01.</p>
  <br />
  <h3>DaVinci Resolve (Studio) by Blackmagicdesign</h3>
  <h4 class="subtitle"><a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve" target="_blank">Free version or real perpetual license (USD$295, price may vary on country or reseller) (studio = paid version)</a></h4>
  <p>
    I mostly use this for longer footage that don't really need complex effects/layers – I'm more inclined to use HitFilm for effects because I'm used to it more.
    <br>
    Has a free version, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtbbKlimFY8" target="_blank">likely good enough for general editing needs</a> and less restricted than HitFilm's free version. Unlike HitFilm's "perpetual" license, this one is just the 1 payment and done, you get free updates as you should.
    <br />
    If practical, keep an eye out for any time-limited deals such as <a href="https://youtu.be/nJ9lIo8CWkY?t=198" target="_blank">buying DaVinci Resolve Studio and getting a free "Speed Editor" keyboard (now expired)</a> for extra value. I don't remember how I came across the deal myself (probably researching the "Speed Editor" itself), but I got the deal in time, helped justify paying the amount for the editing software more since now getting more that just the software. Still, deal or no deal it's cheaper in the long run than HitFilm, having free updates for paid version.
