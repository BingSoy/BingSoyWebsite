  <h3 class=text>On Uncletopia and the state of TF2</h3>
  <p class="ptext text">
  Despite being one that never cheats, Bing Soy sometimes got kicked from the server (Uncletopia).<br />
  Why? <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx_EESME_3C8iW3m0QLNJaNy7u1bcA_HzM" target="_blank">Bing Soy at times does unconventional things in game for fun</a> and sometimes it rubbed some people the wrong way. Sometimes people treat Uncletopia like a private lobby and kick whoever joins. Who knows, maybe Bing Soy is making a big deal out of nothing, but these kicks happened and they made him feel gatekept. Power over Bing Soy to keep him in his place.
  </p>
  <p class="ptext text">
  Ultimately, it's the people's choice whether or not they want Bing Soy on the server, even if it's not right. Whether intended of not, it's a form of bullying when kicks are abused, and what does it say about Bing Soy if he keeps taking it? Think twice before kicking someone, because you are ruining someone's day.<br /><br />
  Even if Bing Soy somehow gets kick immunity, the game is coming to a point for him where the flaws shine much more than the strengths, such as hitscan sniper rifles and the wrangler's damage resistance. Bing Soy has tried hard to push the limits of the game, but that can only keep you going for so long. If we somehow enter a timeline where Valve comes together with the TF2 community+creators to update the game, that could help re-ignite the dying flame of playing TF2. But at this point, it's not viable to wait anymore for Valve. Bing Soy likes TF2, but playing it not so much nowadays.<br /><br />
  Something could be said here about holding a beloved but abandoned game hostage by its current state and not making it open source for a dedicated community to work on, while shutting down other open source derivatives of the game which that were being worked on.<br /><br />
  Look at Valve's actions any way you want – at the end of the day, things are being gatekept from us with secrecy and legal issues. If only we could put the contributions of society before these bureaucratic shenanigans. If we don't treat gaming more seriously (as in the artistic and personal value games hold), will corporations continue to exploit/ignore gamers?<br /><br />Bing Soy may not be the most eloquent but these are passionate words.
    <br /><br />
