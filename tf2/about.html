<p class="ptext text">
  Bing Soy at times plays <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj5vCC_PuSuM8TqQKT9jGTQ/" target="_blank">uploads some of the gameplay on YouTube.</a> Seems to only play on no-crit servers for vanilla/casual TF2 gameplay.
  <br />Do not expect regular videos as Bing Soy wants to focus on the video and mental health, more than consistent uploads. If uploads come, then ok. If not, then ok.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYrsXEwRk9k" target="_blank">Bing Soy at times does unconventional things in game for fun/stimulation.</a></p>

    <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx_EESME_3C8iW3m0QLNJaNy7u1bcA_HzM" target="_blank">Have fun/play how you want at Uncletopia</a> â€” this was meant to link to "TISM Podcast #3 - Uncle Dane" - a podcast featuring Uncle Dane, conducted by braddles, but for an unknown reason he has hidden it. This link was meant to show a clip of Uncle Dane at 1:50:48 of the video where he says something along the lines of not wanting people to not "fuck around" in Uncletopia. <a href="https://youtu.be/J59GKKIyAcI?t=900" target="_blank">It seems that it is true that Uncletopia does go toward lean toward competive more than casual</a> since Bing Soy gets kicked for bad reasons (Bing Soy needs to find a way to shine a light on this as it greatly diminishes his experience on the server). Bing Soy would be ok with being kicked if it is warranted (cheating, griefing, chat abuse) but he gets kicked for stupid reasons, especially considering that it's supposed to be a casual server. Bing Soy would probably want to communicate this in video form because words alone aren't enough. Not for him.<br />Before you kick someone, confirm instead of assume because they are people too. You don't know what they are doing, so talk to them, get to know what they are doing. A fair trial is not reserved for courtrooms alone. A simple act like kicking someone because they aren't playing the game good enough for you may result in the other party feeling at fault for something they didn't do wrong and at the same time feeling less human because people consider you not good enough to play on a casual server and being socially deprived of one of the only outlets of contact with other human beings because this is the game you ended up playing in the end because you dumped the other games because of their toxic playerbases to preserve your own sanity.<br />
    When your escape from a sad reality gets infected by the very same people who you tried to walk away from, does complete isolation become the only logical decision? Life becomes much easier, but harder for everyone else when you don't account for consequences for other  people.
