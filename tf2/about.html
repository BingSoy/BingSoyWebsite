<h2 class="text">About</h2>
<p class="ptext text">
  Bing Soy at times plays <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj5vCC_PuSuM8TqQKT9jGTQ/" target="_blank">uploads some of the gameplay on YouTube.</a>
    <br /><br />
  Despite being one that never cheats, Bing Soy sometimes get kicked from the server.<br />
  Why? Bing Soy does <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx_EESME_3C8iW3m0QLNJaNy7u1bcA_HzM" target="_blank">"fuck around"</a> and sometimes it rubs some people the wrong way.<br /><br />
  To help raise awareness about unfair kicks/bans, Bing Soy will share some incidents:
  </p>
    <ul>
    <li>&lt;(past kick)&gt;</li>
    <li>&lt;(past kick)&gt;</li>
    <li> 2022-02-04: Kicked for "sitting in spawn and taunting all round", which is a clever half-truth lie.<br/></li></ul>
  <p class="ptext text">
  Just know when this happens, Bing Soy is deprived of a what is an already limited social life and it makes him feel unwelcome and gatekept for trying to have fun/do memes and trying not to take the game too seriously because is this casual server or a 9-5 office job? It would be nice for Bing Soy to be kickable only by moderators (not immune to banning in the rare case he goes rogue and becomes a racist aimbotter or something).<br />
  Bing Soy is fortunate that some regulars understand the ways of Bing Soy, but it wasn't always like that. Think twice about the strange/unusual guy you kick from a server as they have their own story.
  <br /><br />
  Ultimately if this isn't against any rules to kick people you deem unworthy of playing on Uncletopia, then Bing Soy must find something else to get passionate about, maybe <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/" target="_blank">Fortnite</a> or <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>. Ideally something with less gatekeeping/singleplayer, because all these little things do add up. Whether intended of not, it's bullying, and what does it say about Bing Soy if he keeps taking it?<br />
  What does it say about us when we let the big guy poke you over, and over again?
    <br /><br />
